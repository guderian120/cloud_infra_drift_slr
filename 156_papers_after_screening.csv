Central to DevOps practices is automation, which addresses the complexity of provisioning and configuring diverse computing environments. This white paper explores state-of-the-art automation tools, with a focus on Ansible for configuration management and Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC). An extensive review of recent scholarly articles, conference papers, and real-world case studies reveals the unique strengths and limitations of these tools, including Ansible’s agentless architecture and Terraform’s robust declarative approach. In examining multi-cloud and hybrid deployments, the paper identifies best practices in modular code design, version control, automated testing, and policy-as-code for security and compliance. Empirical case studies demonstrate the performance, scalability, and maintainability benefits organizations gain from integrating Ansible and Terraform, while also highlighting challenges related to skill gaps, complex orchestration, and state management. Finally, the paper discusses emerging trends, including AI-driven infrastructure provisioning, serverless computing at the edge, and unified frameworks that incorporate multiple automation tools. By synthesizing these findings, this paper contributes a comprehensive roadmap for adopting and optimizing DevOps automation. It underscores how strategic integration of Ansible, Terraform, and complementary solutions not only reduces operational overhead but also enhances reliability, security, and agility. The outcomes empower practitioners and researchers to address current limitations, seize emerging opportunities, and drive further innovation in the rapidly evolving landscape of DevOps automation.

Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a ""source-of-truth"" configuration. They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 9.0): CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift, IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc, IaC: Infrastructure as Code","9","CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift; IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc; IaC: Infrastructure as Code; Cloud: Multi-cloud/hybrid infrastructure","2025","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20211v1","**1.

This paper proposes a conceptual model for a secure DevOps architecture that leverages Jenkins, Terraform, and Kubernetes to ensure continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code (IaC), and container orchestration, all underpinned by robust security principles. Jenkins facilitates automated building, testing, and deployment pipelines, while Terraform enables secure infrastructure provisioning through immutable, version-controlled configurations. Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications, providing dynamic scaling, automated failover, and efficient resource utilization. Together, these tools offer a powerful synergy that can automate development workflows while embedding security measures throughout the software delivery process. The proposed model introduces a security-first approach across the development lifecycle, encompassing code validation, vulnerability scanning, secrets management, policy enforcement, and runtime security. Jenkins pipelines integrate security scanners at multiple stages to detect vulnerabilities early. Terraform configurations are audited for compliance using tools such as Checkov and Terraform Compliance, ensuring secure infrastructure deployment. Kubernetes clusters are fortified with role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, admission controllers, and runtime threat detection solutions like Falco. This conceptual model emphasizes automation, scalability, and proactive threat mitigation, minimizing human error and enabling organizations to achieve secure, rapid software delivery. Additionally, it addresses challenges such as secrets management, with integrations like Vault and Sealed Secrets, and policy enforcement through tools like OPA-Gatekeeper. The model also recommends continuous monitoring and feedback loops to detect anomalies and enforce corrective actions in near real-time. By adopting this secure DevOps architecture, organizations can bridge the gap between agility and security, meeting modern demands for rapid innovation without compromising system integrity. This work contributes to the growing body of DevSecOps knowledge by providing a comprehensive framework that operationalizes security from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment. Future extensions of the model could explore the integration of AI-driven security analytics and self-healing capabilities to further enhance resilience.

This study introduces a novel multi-layer self-healing infrastructure framework that unites predictive analytics, reinforcement learning (RL), and rule-based automation into a cohesive, horizontally scalable system. Predictive analytics continuously ingests telemetry—CPU, memory, network metrics, and application logs—using time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM) and unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, k-Means) to flag potential faults with &gt;96% accuracy. An RL agent employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) then dynamically selects recovery actions (e.g., container restart, horizontal scaling, resource reallocation) guided by a reward function that balances rapid Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) reduction with minimal resource overhead and service impact. Simultaneously, rule-based playbooks address frequent failure patterns, ensuring immediate remediation within 30 seconds for predictable incidents.

The need for IT agility and organizational scalability creates a problematic situation for managing various cloud environments. The document investigates detailed automation solutions for multi-cloud deployments integrating Terraform with Ansible and Kubernetes. Organizations achieve better business response capabilities by combining these strong automation tools, optimizing deployment streamlining while managing resources better and minimizing operational expenses. The primary function of Terraform is to provide an automation framework backbone that enables IaC infrastructure provisioning. Users can deploy cloud infrastructure consistently and repeatedly through Terraform because they define resources in declarative codes that work across major cloud providers. The ability to streamline cloud management across multiple platforms becomes more effective through this feature when operating in a multi-cloud environment. The automation process reaches a higher degree of robustness when using Ansible alongside its configuration management and application deployment capabilities. With a structure that needs no agent, Ansible provides users with straightforward orchestration processes between different platforms, ensuring they can easily manage their resources regardless of their cloud provider types. With its fundamental capabilities to orchestrate containers, Kubernetes plays a crucial role in a multi-cloud environment. It enables the deployment and management of applications, thereby automating application deployment and management for enterprise organizations. This results in consistent and reliable execution across various cloud systems. Developers can create an automated workflow connecting infrastructure provisioning to application deployment processes. This end-to-end automation framework significantly improves operational efficiency, reduces product delivery schedules, and helps organizations develop a robust cloud strategy, enhancing market competitiveness.

As more organizations adopt cloud environments, they experience challenges that arise from cloud infrastructure management. AWS Cloud Formation helps overcome these challenges by presenting a single, declarative, resource-provisioning model. In this paper, you learn the value of AWS Cloud Formation, such as its capacity to create and manage resources, including EC2 instances, VPCs, and load balancers for you.

However, migrating IT infrastructure to the cloud presents significant challenges, particularly for organizations with limited budgets, dependency on costly proprietary cloud tools, complex migration procedures, and a lack of technical expertise. These obstacles are especially evident in regions like Africa, where the adoption of cloud solutions remains restricted due to financial and technical barriers. This research tackles these challenges by developing and implementing an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) template tailored for cost-effective cloud infrastructure management, using Microsoft Azure as a case study. The project developed and tested a reusable IaC template using tools like Terraform, Visual Studio Code, and Azure CLI. It optimized costs with a monitoring bash script that was executed on one of the Linux-based virtual machines that was created on the Azure portal during the implementation of IaC and ensured reliability via extensive validation thereby reducing the deployment time and costs by approximately 90% as compared to standard Azure configurations. The proposed solution harnesses open-source tools and industry best practices to streamline cloud resource deployment and management, reducing the reliance on expensive inbuilt services and lowering the technical barriers to cloud adoption. By automating the infrastructure provisioning process, the IaC template enables companies to efficiently manage their cloud environments, optimize costs by approximately 30% on infrastructure management, incur 0% costs on resource monitoring and maintain flexibility. The initiative is focused on empowering businesses in resource-constrained environments to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities without incurring prohibitive expenses. It addresses key issues such as budget constraints, technical complexities, and inefficient management practices, providing a pathway for wider cloud adoption in economically developing regions.

The Deployment Manager is native to Google Cloud Services while Terraform is not. The study assesses the deployment and management of cloud resources by using these tools, and examines their integration benefits, flexibility, and multi-cloud capabilities. It highlights Terraform's consistently faster resource destruction times compared to Google Cloud Deployment Manager, as evidenced by tests using the Linux 'time' command, providing insights into their operational efficiency and adaptability in cloud environments. Our findings indicate that the native Google Cloud Deployment Manager better integrates with its resources. In contrast, Terraform is versatile, provides better flexibility and deploys faster. Its independence is more useful in working with various cloud environments – and is not limited to GCP. Additionally, to gain insight, this study discusses the benefits and inherent challenges associated with IaC.

However, different cloud service providers utilize diverse IaC formats. The lack of a standardized format requires cloud architects to be proficient in multiple IaC languages, adding complexity to cloud deployment. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating IaC creation and maintenance, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks across multiple IaC formats. We present Multi-IaC-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset for evaluating LLM-based IaC generation and mutation across AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) formats. The dataset consists of triplets containing initial IaC templates, natural language modification requests, and corresponding updated templates, created through a synthetic data generation pipeline with rigorous validation. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IaC-Bench, demonstrating that while modern LLMs can achieve high success rates (>95%) in generating syntactically valid IaC across formats, significant challenges remain in semantic alignment and handling complex infrastructure patterns.

Modern software development has evolved to embrace IaC as a best practice for consistently provisioning and managing infrastructure using various tools such as Terraform and Ansible. However, recent studies highlighted that developers still encounter various challenges with IaC tools. Aims. We aim in this paper to understand the different challenges that developers encounter with IaC and analyze the trend of seeking assistance on Q&A platforms in the context of IaC. To this end, we conduct a large-scale empirical study investigating developers' discussions in Stack Overflow. Method. We first collect IaC-relevant tags on Stack Overflow, constituting a dataset that comprises 52,692 questions and 64,078 answers. Then, we group questions into specific topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method, which we optimize using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter's fine-tuning. Finally, to gain better insights, we analyze the identified topics based on different criteria such as popularity and difficulty. Results. Our findings reveal an average yearly increase of 150% in terms of IaC-related questions and 135% in terms of users between 2011 and 2022. Furthermore, we observe that IaC questions revolve around seven main topics: server configuration, policy configuration, networking, deployment pipelines, variable management, templating, and file management. Notably, we found that server configuration and file management are the most popular topics, i.e., the most discussed among IaC developers, while the deployment pipelines and templating topics are the most difficult. Conclusions. Our results shed light on IaC challenges that are often encountered by developers on popular Q&A platforms. These findings reveal important implications for practitioners seeking better support for IaC tools in real-world settings and for researchers to better understand the IaC community needs and further investigate IaC in different aspects.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 6.0): IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc, IaC: Infrastructure as Code, Cloud: Multi-cloud/hybrid infrastructure","6","IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc; IaC: Infrastructure as Code; Cloud: Multi-cloud/hybrid infrastructure","2023","Not available","Here's a structured summary based on the provided metadata:

The IaC approach supports code-centric tools that use scripts to specify the creation, updating and execution of cloud infrastructure resources. Since each cloud provider offers a different type of infrastructure, the definition of an infrastructure resource (e.g., a virtual machine) implies writing several lines of code that greatly depend on the target cloud provider. Model-driven tools, meanwhile, abstract the complexity of using IaC scripts through the high-level modeling of the cloud infrastructure. In a previous work, we presented an infrastructure modeling approach and tool (Argon) for cloud provisioning that leverages model-driven engineering and supports the IaC approach. The objective of the present work is to compare a model-driven tool (Argon) with a well-known code-centric tool (Ansible) in order to provide empirical evidence of their effectiveness when defining the cloud infrastructure, and the participants' perceptions when using these tools. We, therefore, conducted a family of three experiments involving 67 Computer Science students in order to compare Argon with Ansible as regards their effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. We used the AB/BA crossover design to configure the individual experiments and the linear mixed model to statistically analyze the data collected and subsequently obtain empirical findings. The results of the individual experiments and meta-analysis indicate that Argon is more effective as regards supporting the IaC approach in terms of defining the cloud infrastructure. The participants also perceived that Argon is easier to use and more useful for specifying the infrastructure resources. Our findings suggest that Argon accelerates the provisioning process by modeling the cloud infrastructure and automating the generation of scripts for different DevOps tools when compared to Ansible, which is a code-centric tool that is greatly used in practice.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 6.0): IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc, IaC: Infrastructure as Code, Cloud: Multi-cloud/hybrid infrastructure","6","IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc; IaC: Infrastructure as Code; Cloud: Multi-cloud/hybrid infrastructure","2020","/pdf/on-the-effectiveness-of-tools-to-support-infrastructure-as-39et69r222.pdf","Here is a structured summary based on the provided metadata:

Instead, IT organizations heavily rely on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies, to automate the provisioning, configuration, and maintenance of computing infrastructures and systems. IaC systems typically offer declarative, domain-specific languages (DSLs) that allow system administrators and developers to write high-level programs that specify the desired state of their infrastructure in a reliable, predictable, and documented fashion. Just like traditional programs, IaC software is not immune to faults, with issues ranging from deployment failures to critical misconfigurations that often impact production systems used by millions of end users. Surprisingly, despite its crucial role in global infrastructure management, the tooling and techniques for ensuring IaC reliability still have room for improvement. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 360 bugs identified in IaC software within prominent IaC ecosystems including Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. Our work is the first in-depth exploration of bug characteristics in these widely-used IaC environments. Through our analysis we aim to understand: (1) how these bugs manifest, (2) their underlying root causes, (3) their reproduction requirements in terms of system state (e.g., operating system versions) or input characteristics, and (4) how these bugs are fixed. Based on our findings, we evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques for IaC reliability, identify their limitations, and provide a set of recommendations for future research. We believe that our study helps researchers to (1) better understand the complexity and peculiarities of IaC software, and (2) develop advanced tooling for more reliable and robust system configurations.

If left unaddressed, model drift can lead to inaccurate predictions, biased outcomes, and poor business decisions. To mitigate this risk, automated model monitoring and real-time retraining are essential in modern ML pipelines. Model drift can manifest in several forms, including concept drift, where the relationship between features and labels changes; covariate shift, where the distribution of input features evolves; and label drift, where the frequency of class labels varies over time. Detecting and addressing model drift is crucial for maintaining model accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications such as financial fraud detection, healthcare diagnostics, and predictive maintenance. This paper explores various methodologies for detecting model drift, including statistical techniques, drift detection algorithms, and real-time anomaly detection frameworks. We discuss key performance monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, AWS SageMaker Model Monitor, and Evidently AI that facilitate proactive drift identification. Additionally, we highlight strategies for implementing automated model retraining pipelines using MLOps frameworks like Kubeflow, Apache Airflow, and MLflow, ensuring seamless integration with production environments. A significant focus is placed on real-time retraining approaches, where model updates are triggered dynamically based on performance metrics, drift thresholds, and adaptive learning mechanisms. We analyze trade-offs between scheduled vs. event-driven retraining, discuss CI/CD workflows for ML models, and present case studies that showcase the impact of drift management in real-world applications. Finally, we address challenges associated with automated drift mitigation, including computational cost, ethical considerations, and data latency issues. Future research directions explore the role of federated learning, large-scale reinforcement learning, and AI-augmented drift detection techniques to enhance robustness in continuously evolving ML systems. Through a comprehensive study of model drift detection and mitigation strategies, this paper aims to provide actionable insights for data scientists, MLOps engineers, and AI practitioners to build resilient, self-healing ML pipelines that sustain performance in dynamic data environments.

This systematic review aims to evaluate and synthesize the current landscape of integration techniques used in hybrid cloud infrastructure projects, with a focus on interoperability, orchestration, data synchronization, and security compliance. This examines peer-reviewed literature, technical white papers, and industry reports published between 2015 and 2024 to identify dominant patterns, frameworks, and tools employed in hybrid cloud integration. Findings indicate that integration strategies in hybrid cloud environments often rely on middleware platforms, API gateways, container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. Middleware and APIs serve as critical enablers for seamless communication between heterogeneous systems, while containerization ensures portability across cloud boundaries. Moreover, service mesh architectures and microservices-based designs are increasingly adopted to enhance scalability and observability. Security and compliance integration techniques, including identity federation, encryption standards, and policy-as-code frameworks, are also frequently cited to address regulatory requirements.

They promote the usage of code to define and configure the IT infrastructure of cloud applications allowing them to benefit from conventional software development practices, which facilitates the rapid deployment of new versions of application infrastructures without sacrificing quality or stability. On the other hand, enterprise applications need to conform to compliance regarding external regulations and internal policies. Many of these compliance rules affect the application architecture on which IaC code operates. However, managing the architectural compliance of IaC-based application deployments faces a number of challenges, such as configuration drift and the heterogeneity of IaC technologies. Therefore, in this work, we present a vision on how to uniformly manage the compliance of the infrastructure of applications that utilize heterogeneous IaC technologies for deployment automation. To this end, we introduce an initial design for the IaC-based Architectural Compliance Management Framework and discuss how it addresses the corresponding challenges.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 5.0): CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift, IaC: Infrastructure as Code","5","CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift; IaC: Infrastructure as Code","2022","Not available","**1.

However, it's extremely challenging to orchestrate the underlying infrastructure for such a distributed system, such as complexity, consistency, and governance at scale. To address these, automation through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a front-runner, allowing for declarative provisioning of infrastructure, while Policy as Code (PaC) enforces security, compliance, and operational policy governance through codified policies. This study tries to provide a holistic model that combines IaC and PaC to automate infrastructure provisioning and policy enforcement in a consistent way throughout the deployment pipeline.

However, during the development of these scripts, some code patterns or deployment choices may lead to sustainability issues like inefficient resource utilization or redundant provisioning for example. We call this type of patterns sustainability smells. These inefficiencies pose significant environmental and financial challenges, given the growing scale of cloud computing. This research focuses on Terraform, a widely adopted IaC tool. Our study involves defining seven sustainability smells and validating them through a survey with 19 IaC practitioners. We utilized a dataset of 28,327 Terraform scripts from 395 open-source repositories. We performed a detailed qualitative analysis of a randomly sampled 1,860 Terraform scripts from the original dataset to identify code patterns that correspond to the sustainability smells and used the other 26,467 Terraform scripts to study the prevalence of the defined sustainability smells. Our results indicate varying prevalence rates of these smells across the dataset. The most prevalent smell is Monolithic Infrastructure, which appears in 9.67\% of the scripts.

Further, there is a need for flexible, timely reconfiguration of the infrastructure, e.g., to use pay-per-use infrastructure efficiently based on application load. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the DevOps tool to automate infrastructure. However, modern static IaC solutions only support infrastructures that are deployed and do not change afterward. To implement infrastructures that change dynamically over time, static IaC programs have to be (updated and) re-run, e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline, or configure an external orchestrator that implements the dynamic behavior, e.g., an autoscaler or Kubernetes operator. Both do not capture the dynamic behavior in the IaC program and prevent analyzing and testing the infrastructure configuration jointly with its dynamic behavior. To fill this gap, we envision dynamic IaC, which augments static IaC with the ability to define dynamic behavior within the IaC program. In contrast to static IaC programs, dynamic IaC programs run continuously. They re-evaluate program parts that depend on external signals when these change and automatically adjust the infrastructure accordingly. We implement DIaC as the first dynamic IaC solution and demonstrate it in two realistic use cases of broader relevance. With dynamic IaC, ensuring the program’s correctness is even harder than for static IaC because programs may define many target configurations in contrast to only a few. However, for this reason, it is also more critical. To solve this issue, we propose automated, specialized property-based testing for IaC programs and implement it in ProTI.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 4.0): IaC: Infrastructure as Code, GitOps: ArgoCD/Flux/declarative, Containers: Kubernetes/orchestration","4.0","IaC: Infrastructure as Code; GitOps: ArgoCD/Flux/declarative; Containers: Kubernetes/orchestration","2022","/pdf/infrastructure-as-code-for-dynamic-deployments-1dkms5jq.pdf","Here's a structured summary based on the provided metadata:

João F. Ferreira","10.1145/3551349.3556945","","Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing IT infrastructure via programmable configuration files (also called IaC scripts). Like other software artifacts, IaC scripts may contain security smells, which are coding patterns that can result in security weaknesses. Automated analysis tools to detect security smells in IaC scripts exist, but they focus on specific technologies such as Puppet, Ansible, or Chef. This means that when the detection of a new smell is implemented in one of the tools, it is not immediately available for the technologies supported by the other tools — the only option is to duplicate the effort. This paper presents an approach that enables consistent security smell detection across different IaC technologies. We conduct a large-scale empirical study that analyzes security smells on three large datasets containing 196,755 IaC scripts and 12,281,251 LOC. We show that all categories of security smells are identified across all datasets and we identify some smells that might affect many IaC projects. To conduct this study, we developed GLITCH, a new technology-agnostic framework that enables automated polyglot smell detection by transforming IaC scripts into an intermediate representation, on which different security smell detectors can be defined. GLITCH currently supports the detection of nine different security smells in scripts written in Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. We compare GLITCH with state-of-the-art security smell detectors. The results obtained not only show that GLITCH can reduce the effort of writing security smell analyses for multiple IaC technologies, but also that it has higher precision and recall than the current state-of-the-art tools.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 4.0): IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc, IaC: Infrastructure as Code","4","IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc; IaC: Infrastructure as Code","2022","Not available","**1.

The research profile focuses on a methodology known in the professional environment as “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC) and is one of the foundational methodologies implemented in a systemic combination within the DevOps methodology. This methodology is actively used in processes of dynamic formation, deployment, and maintenance of corporate IT infrastructures in many modern successful high-tech companies to achieve the best business performance, efficiency, guaranteed success, and security. The article discusses two basic approaches to building software tools that implement the IaC methodology, namely the declarative and imperative approaches. The main emphasis is placed on the formation of a set of advantages and disadvantages inherent in software tools such as Terraform, ARM, Ansible, and CloudFormation. The focus of researchers on these four software tools is explained by their leading positions in a fairly extensive lineup of possible alternative software products that allow for a comprehensive implementation of the IaC methodology in the context of full and functional systemic deployment of the DevOps methodology in specific implementations of corporate IT infrastructures. The authors' generalized conclusion of original scientific research is that there is currently no single clearly distinguished universal software tool among others that fully satisfies the entire spectrum of requirements and needs.

Objective: From a maintenance and evolution perspective, the topic has picked the interest of practitioners and academics alike, given the relative scarcity of supporting patterns and practices in the academic literature. At the same time, a considerable amount of gray literature exists on IaC. Thus we aim to characterize IaC and compile a catalog of best and bad practices for widely used IaC languages, all using gray literature materials. Method: In this paper, we systematically analyze the industrial gray literature on IaC, such as blog posts, tutorials, white papers using qualitative analysis techniques. Results: We proposed a definition for IaC and distilled a broad catalog summarized in a taxonomy consisting of 10 and 4 primary categories for best practices and bad practices, respectively, both language-agnostic and language-specific ones, for three IaC languages, namely Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. The practices reflect implementation issues, design issues, and the violation of/adherence to the essential principles of IaC.

As state reconciliation is pivotal to manage IaC-based computing infrastructure at scale, defects related to state reconciliation can create large-scale consequences. A categorization of state reconciliation defects, i.e., defects related to state reconciliation, can aid in understanding the nature of state reconciliation defects. We conduct an empirical study with 5,110 state reconciliation defects where we apply qualitative analysis to categorize state reconciliation defects. From the identified defect categories, we derive heuristics to design prompts for a large language model (LLM), which in turn are used for validation of state reconciliation. From our empirical study, we identify 8 categories of state reconciliation defects, amongst which 3 have not been reported for previously-studied software systems. The most frequently occurring defect category is inventory, i.e., the category of defects that occur when managing infrastructure inventory. Using an LLM with heuristics-based paragraph style prompts, we identify 9 previously unknown state reconciliation defects of which 7 have been accepted as valid defects, and 4 have already been fixed.

This automation is enabled by the explicit definition of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), i.e., a set of scripts, often written in different modelling languages, which defines the infrastructure and applications to be deployed. We introduce the DevOps Modelling Language (DOML), a new Cloud modelling language for infrastructure deployments. DOML is a modelling approach that can be mapped into multiple IaC languages, addressing infrastructure provisioning, application deployment and configuration at once. The idea behind DOML is to use a single modelling paradigm which can help to reduce the need of deep technical expertise in using different specialised IaC languages. We present the DOML’s principles and discuss the related work on IaC languages. We demonstrate the DOML advantages for the end-user in comparison with state-of-the-art IaC languages such as Ansible, Terraform, and Cloudify, and show its effectiveness through an example.

IaC relies on source code files rather than manual configuration to manage the infrastructure of a software system. Terraform, an IaC tool and its declarative configuration language named HCL, has recently garnered considerable attention among IaC practitioners. Like other software artefacts, Terraform files could be affected by misconfigurations, faults, and smells. Therefore, DevOps practitioners might benefit from a quality assurance tool to help them perform quality assurance activities on Terrafrom artefacts. This paper introduces TerraMetrics, an open-source tool designed to characterize the quality of Terraform artefacts by providing a catalogue of 40 quality metrics. TerraMetrics leverages the Terraform Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract the metric list, offering a potentially enduring solution compared to conventional regular expressions. This tool comprises three main components: (i) a parser transforming HCL code into an AST, (ii) visitors that traverse the AST nodes to extract the metrics, and (iii) collectors for storing the collected metrics in JSON format. The TerraMetrics tool is publicly available as an Open Source tool, with a demo video, at: https://github.com/stilab-ets/terametrics.

Guido Salvaneschi","10.1109/ICSA-C57050.2023.00072","","Modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) programs are increasingly complex and much closer to traditional software than to simple configuration scripts. Their reliability is crucial because their failure prevents the deployment of applications, and incorrect behavior can introduce malfunction and severe security issues. Yet, software engineering tools to develop reliable programs, such as testing and verification, are barely used in IaC. In fact, we observed that developers mainly rely on integration testing, a slow and expensive practice that can increase confidence in end-to-end functionality but is infeasible to systematically test IaC programs in various configurations—which is required to ensure robustness. On the other hand, fast testing techniques, such as unit testing, are cumbersome with IaC programs because, today, they require significant coding overhead while only providing limited confidence.To solve this issue, we envision the automated testing tool ProTI, reducing the manual overhead and boosting confidence in the test results. ProTI embraces modern unit testing techniques to test IaC programs in many different configurations. Out of the box, ProTI is a fuzzer for Pulumi TypeScript IaC programs, randomly testing the program in many different configurations for termination, configuration correctness, and existing policy compliance. Then developers can add specifications to their program to guide random-based value generation, test additional properties, and add further mocking, making ProTI a property-based testing tool.

This automation is done through code-based specification files, commonly known as IaC files. Similarly to other code files, IaC files can suffer from violations of established implementation and design standards, i.e., IaC smells. Although prior research has studied various aspects of traditional smells in non-IaC artifacts, there is little knowledge of how IaC smells are prevalent, co-occurring, and impacting the change and defect proneness of IaC code. To fill this gap, we conduct an empirical study encompassing 82 Puppet-based open-source projects. Our investigation focused on 12 types of IaC smells in both implementation and design levels. Our findings reveal that IaC smells do not manifest uniformly, as IaC smells that are particularly associated with modularity issues, exhibit high prevalence rates across projects. Additionally, we found that 74% of IaC files are smelly and over 52% of the smelly IaC files have at least two co-occurring IaC smells. Furthermore, our findings highlight that, on average, smelly IaC files are modified nearly 3.8 times, in terms of number of commits, more frequently than non-smelly IaC files. Furthermore, smelly IaC files are found to be 3.1 times more prone to larger code changes, in terms of code churn, than non-smelly IaC files. Additionally, we found that smelly IaC files are 3.3 times more prone to the introduction of defects that are likely to persist in 1.65 more commits before being fixed than non-smelly IaC files. These findings advocate developers to be more aware of IaC smells in their projects and consider their correction.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 4.0): IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc, IaC: Infrastructure as Code","4","IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc; IaC: Infrastructure as Code","2024","Not available","**1.

Software services must be deployed to a target run time environment and provisioning that environment through manual user actions is tedious and error-prone. Provisioning manually also becomes prohibitive as the number of resources grow and spread globally over multiple regions. The answer is to apply the same rigor to provisioning the infrastructure as applied to developing the application software.

By writing a configuration in IaC languages such as CloudFormation, users can declaratively specify their infrastructure and CloudFormation will handle the creation of the resources. However, understanding the complexity of IaC deployments has emerged as an unsolved issue. In particular, estimating the cost of an IaC deployment requires estimating the future usage and pricing models of every cloud resource in the deployment. Gaining transparency into predicted usage/costs is a leading challenge in cloud management. Existing work either relies on historical usage metrics to predict cost or on coarse-grain static analysis that ignores interactions between resources.

Tegawende F. Bissyande","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18790v1","Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure through scripts and tools, streamlining software deployment. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 4.0): IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc, IaC: Infrastructure as Code","4","IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc; IaC: Infrastructure as Code","2025","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18790v1","Here is a structured summary based on the provided metadata:

As infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts, such as Ansible and Chef scripts, are used to provision cloud-based servers and systems at scale, security smells in IaC scripts could be used to enable malicious users to exploit vulnerabilities in the provisioned systems. Goal: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners avoid insecure coding practices while developing infrastructure as code scripts through an empirical study of security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts. Methodology: We conduct a replication study where we apply qualitative analysis with 1,956 IaC scripts to identify security smells for IaC scripts written in two languages: Ansible and Chef. We construct a static analysis tool called Security Linter for Ansible and Chef scripts (SLAC) to automatically identify security smells in 50,323 scripts collected from 813 open source software repositories. We also submit bug reports for 1,000 randomly-selected smell occurrences. Results: We identify two security smells not reported in prior work: missing default in case statement and no integrity check. By applying SLAC we identify 46,600 occurrences of security smells that include 7,849 hard-coded passwords. We observe agreement for 65 of the responded 94 bug reports, which suggests the relevance of security smells for Ansible and Chef scripts amongst practitioners. Conclusion: We observe security smells to be prevalent in Ansible and Chef scripts, similar to that of the Puppet scripts. We recommend practitioners to rigorously inspect the presence of the identified security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts using (i) code review, and (ii) static analysis tools.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 4.0): IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc, IaC: Infrastructure as Code","4","IaC Tools: Terraform/CloudFormation/etc; IaC: Infrastructure as Code","2019","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07159v2","**1.

However, this advancement presents new challenges in governance, compliance, and management, necessitating a comprehensive policy framework to ensure secure, ethical, and effective cloud usage. This review examines a robust policy framework designed to address these challenges, focusing on the integration of AI, governance practices, regulatory compliance, and cloud management. The framework outlines specific policies for AI, emphasizing ethical considerations, accountability, and transparency, alongside mechanisms for privacy and bias mitigation to foster responsible AI deployment in cloud environments. Governance policies are structured to establish clear data stewardship, risk management, and continuous monitoring protocols, ensuring that cloud resources align with organizational and regulatory standards. Moreover, compliance is addressed through adherence to global standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, with an emphasis on data sovereignty, auditability, and vendor accountability to maintain regulatory alignment across jurisdictions. Management policies within the framework focus on optimizing resource allocation, enforcing Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and developing disaster recovery and business continuity strategies. These management policies aim to balance cost-efficiency with performance reliability. Recognizing the complexities of multi-cloud and hybrid environments, the framework proposes adaptable guidelines that accommodate rapid technological shifts and address security and privacy risks inherent in cloud computing. Through case studies and best practices, this framework offers actionable insights for organizations seeking to implement secure, compliant, and efficient cloud systems. In exploring the future landscape, the review anticipates emerging regulations and underscores the importance of industry-wide collaboration in refining cloud policies.

As a result, this integration must come with several pulls that have to be dealt with to realize proper implementation. This paper seeks to identify the major issues of implementing AI and coming up with the best solutions in multi-cloud infrastructures. Firstly, compatibility problems appear as a fundamental issue in the process of implementing AI across more than one cloud. Every cloud provider uses different APIs, formats for data, and possibilities to configure the infrastructure that hinders data and services integration. To counter this, there is a need to have the compliance that comes in terms of standard development through the use of data formats, APIs, and interoperability frameworks. Furthermore, features such as Docker and Kubernetes make the work with ports lighter and let the AI components smoothly interconnect regardless of the used cloud environment. Secondly, data management as well as the governance of big data serve up significant challenges for multi-cloud AI implementation. Legal requirements concerning data privacy, global compliance standards, as well as data sovereignty concerns call for strong governance of cloud data to ensure they are accurate, secure, as well as compliant in the required cloud settings. These risks must be addressed, nonetheless, to build trust in the multi-cloud AI utilization; in this regard, robust data management, encompassing data encryption, access privileges, as well as data auditing, can be implemented in organizational settings. In addition, the optimization of performance is another significant issue to consider as AI computational tasks may be executed across different cloud environments resulting in increased throughput time and network congestion and contention. Through auto-scaling and workload scheduling algorithms used in orchestration, resources can be effectively allocated and loaded in the heterogeneous cloud infrastructures in the most efficient and optimum way thus reducing operational costs. The other is achieving robustness and dependability of multi-cloud AI applications. It is an immutable fact that one can always imagine a situation when clouds, networks, or hardware will fail; therefore, specific measures should be taken to ensure the availability and reliability of the system. The TCP/IP model also classes the means used for implementing redundant mechanisms, data replication strategies and disaster recovery protocols in different geographically situated cloud regions that improve the dependable computing system’s resources.

This is a significant concern for ML-enabled devices in clinical settings, where data drift may cause unexpected performance that jeopardizes patient safety. Method: We propose a ML-enabled Statistical Process Control (SPC) framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and drift monitoring. SPC is advantageous as it visually and statistically highlights deviations from the expected distribution. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for monitoring data drift in radiological images, we investigated different design choices, including methods for extracting feature representations, drift quantification, and SPC parameter selection. Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for two tasks: 1) differentiating axial vs. non-axial computed tomography (CT) images and 2) separating chest x-ray (CXR) from other modalities. For both tasks, we achieved high accuracy in detecting OOD inputs, with 0.913 in CT and 0.995 in CXR, and sensitivity of 0.980 in CT and 0.984 in CXR. Our framework was also adept at monitoring data streams and identifying the time a drift occurred. In a simulation with 100 daily CXR cases, we detected a drift in OOD input percentage from 0-1% to 3-5% within two days, maintaining a low false-positive rate. Through additional experimental results, we demonstrate the framework's data-agnostic nature and independence from the underlying model's structure.

Hervé Rivano","10.1109/TASE.2022.3182289","","In recent years, low-cost sensors have raised strong interest for environmental monitoring applications. These instruments often suffer from degraded data quality. Notably, they are prone to drift. It can be mitigated with costly periodic calibrations. To reduce this cost, in situ calibration strategies have emerged, enabling the recalibration of instruments while leaving them in the field. However, they rarely identify which instruments actually need a calibration because of drift, so that in situ calibration may instead degrade performances. Therefore, a novel drift detection algorithm is presented in this work, exploiting the concept of rendez-vous between measuring instruments. Its originality lies mainly in the comparisons of values determining the state of the instruments, for which the quality of the measurement results is taken into account. It defines the concept of compatibility between measurement results. A case study is developed, showing an accuracy of 88% for correct detection of drifting instruments. The results of the diagnosis algorithm are then combined with calibration approaches. Results show a significant improvement of the measurement results. Notably, an increase of 15% of the coefficient of determination of the linear regression between their true values and the measured values is observed with the correction and the error on the slope and on the intercept respectively is reduced by 50% and 60% at least. Note to Practitioners—In this paper, we investigate the problem of drift detection in sensor networks. This work was motivated by the fact that faulty nodes are rarely detected in existing in situ calibration algorithm prior to the correction of the instruments. Moreover, existing fault diagnosis algorithms for sensor networks do not specifically target drift and are often applicable to either (dense) static or mobile sensor networks but not both. We propose an algorithm designed for the detection of drift faults regardless of the type of sensor network and of the measurand. Specific attention is paid to the metrological quality of the measurement results used to carry out the diagnosis. The output of the algorithm provides information that can be exploited for the recalibration of faulty instruments. In future work, we will aim at providing tools and recommendations for the adjusment of the parameters of the diagnosis algorithm but also more elaborated approaches based on the results of our diagnosis algorithm to calibrate faulty nodes.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 3.0): CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift","3","CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift","2023","Not available","**1.

It defines the concept of compatibility between measurement results. The algorithm is designed for the detection of drift faults regardless of the type of sensor network and of the measurand.

**2. Drift Remediation Strategies**
The results of the diagnosis algorithm are combined with calibration approaches. The output of the algorithm provides information that can be exploited for the recalibration of faulty instruments.

**6. Key Contributions**
- A novel rendez-vous-based drift detection algorithm for sensor networks.
- The algorithm takes into account the quality of measurement results and defines compatibility between them.
- It provides an accuracy of 88% for correct detection of drifting instruments.
- When combined with calibration approaches, it significantly improves measurement results, showing a 15% increase in the coefficient of determination and at least a 50% reduction in error on the slope and 60% on the intercept.
- The algorithm addresses the problem of faulty nodes rarely being detected in existing in situ calibration algorithms prior to correction.
- It is applicable to both static and mobile sensor networks and is independent of the measurand.

**7. Evaluation & Metrics**
- **Evaluation Method**: Case study.
- **Metrics Reported**:
    - Accuracy of 88% for correct detection of drifting instruments.
    - 15% increase of the coefficient of determination of the linear regression between true values and measured values after correction.
    - Reduction of error on the slope by at least 50%.
    - Reduction of error on the intercept by at least 60%.

**8. Limitations & Challenges**
- Existing in situ calibration algorithms rarely identify which instruments actually need calibration because of drift, potentially degrading performance.
- Existing fault diagnosis algorithms for sensor networks do not specifically target drift and are often applicable to either dense static or mobile sensor networks, but not both.

**9. Practical Recommendations**
- The paper investigates drift detection in sensor networks, motivated by the lack of faulty node detection in existing in situ calibration algorithms.
- The proposed algorithm is designed for drift fault detection regardless of sensor network type or measurand.
- Specific attention is paid to the metrological quality of measurement results for diagnosis.
- The algorithm's output provides information for recalibrating faulty instruments.
- Future work will aim at providing tools and recommendations for adjusting diagnosis algorithm parameters and more elaborated calibration approaches for faulty nodes."

Therefore, one of the main focus for monitoring the model should be towards identifying the drifts in the data that might affect the performance of the model. The traditional drift detecting methods are usually based on some assumptions related to the underlying data such as no inter-dependence. However industrial sensor data typically consists of time series data, which is collected at regular intervals. Therefore, detecting drift in dependent data where the current readings depend on the previously registered readings demands a different approach. Existing solutions require either the ground truth, a fixed size, or the underlying model details. We propose an Unsupervised Drift Detection method for industrial Time series data or UDDT, a generic approach with no such pre-requisites. In our approach, we can check whether two series belong to the same model. Apart from detecting the drift in the two series, it can also provide the rationale behind the observed drift, i.e., whether the drift is due to a difference in stationarity, correlation structures, or noise distributions. We evaluate the UDDT on two datasets to demonstrate its correctness and the trust regions under various circumstances. We also establish its applicability for the real industrial setting.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 3.0): CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift","3","CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift","2023","Not available","**Full-Text Analysis**

In a live environment, with evolving data, the risk is for the model to become ill-adapted for the given situation. The failure to detect drift while leading to a performance deterioration could also cause side effects due to model over-trust. Informing the user of any anomaly upon detection is the key to enabling any action. We propose Shap-ADWIN, a novel approach improving the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors such as ADWIN by leveraging the information brought by Shapley Loss Values. While common practice is to monitor the evolution of the loss of models at most for every predicted instance, the proposed solution monitors each individual instance and features the Shapley Loss value. Whenever the loss is attributed more toward a given feature the information becomes more contrasted, which enables a better detection. Indeed the signal-to-noise ratio is higher on that feature and allows the detector to leverage that information. The opposite case being equal Shapley values that are just the Loss under-scaled for every feature. Moreover, noise over the output would be equally distributed along with each Shapley Loss value of every feature providing lower information to noise ratio and allows a more reliable detection. We provide: a restricted proof, experiments and source code.

Many online learning schemes include drift detection to actively detect and react to observed changes. Yet, reliable drift detection constitutes a challenging problem in particular in the context of high dimensional data, varying drift characteristics, and the absence of a parametric model such as a classification scheme which reflects the drift. In this paper we present a novel concept drift detection method, Dynamic Adapting Window Independence Drift Detection (DAWIDD), which aims for non-parametric drift detection of diverse drift characteristics. For this purpose, we establish a mathematical equivalence of the presence of drift to the dependency of specific random variables in an according drift process.

This study compares five different statistical tests, namely four unidimensional and a new multidimensional test (MSPC), to identify data drift in both mean and deviation. While some are designed to detect drift in mean only, like our multidimensional proposal, others respond to changes in both mean and deviation. However, our Hotelling multidimensional method can be trained once and then applied in a single stage to any data stream with several attributes, and it can identify the most relevant variables causing a data drift with one execution, thus avoiding the need for a single univariate test for each attribute.

Concept drift detection tracks data distribution changes and signals when to update models. Many drift detection methods apply thresholds to distinguish between drift or non-drift streams and to claim their method outperforms others with non-aligned drift thresholds. We consider that selecting a proper drift threshold could be more important than developing a new drift detection algorithm, and different drift detection algorithms may end up with very similar performance with aligned drift thresholds. To better understand this process, we propose a novel threshold selection algorithm to align the drift thresholds of a set of algorithms so that they are all at the same sensitivity level. Based on comprehensive experiment evaluations, we observed that several state-of-the-art drift detection algorithms could achieve similar results by aligning their thresholds, providing a novel insight to explain how drift detection algorithms contribute to data stream learning.

Current drift detection methods, focusing on prediction performance or data distribution, often neglect temporal dependencies and require prior distribution assumptions. These limitations have catalyzed the development of dynamic theory-based approaches that identify drifts by discerning variations in data dynamics. However, the majority of these exhibit high complexity in dynamics characterization and still underperform in industrial drift detection. To overcome these challenges, we propose a singular spectrum analysis-based drift detection method for industry data streams, comprising three modules: common dynamics extraction, noise-robust drift detection, and threshold adaptation. Our approach uses singular spectrum analysis (SSA) as the dynamics representation method instead of traditional high-dimensional phase space embedding and Fourier transform. SSA allows for the efficient description of principal dynamics by intelligently mixing the Fourier basis functions according to given data. The first two modules are specifically engineered to address the common dynamics and stochastic noise inherent in industrial data streams through a well-designed online common dynamics extraction algorithm and a noise-robust detection index respectively. Threshold adaptation module provides a more reasonable way of updating the drift threshold based on the extreme value theory, ensuring global consistency for parameter estimation of extreme value distribution. Our proposed method was tested on simulated examples and a real-world sintering process, exhibiting enhanced drift detection performance.

Due to the damage to machine components, manufacturing processes degrade over time, resulting in substandard products. Generally, statistical process control tools such as control charts aid in identifying patterns and trends indicative of process changes. This investigation delves into the effectiveness of cumulative sum control charts using the sample mean and median as plotting statistics. Run-length measurements assess performance after the charts experience linear and quadratic drifts in non-normal setups under zero- and steady-state conditions. The findings reveal that Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts outperform zero-state monitoring compared to steady-state monitoring. Notably, the CUSUM chart for the mean is suitable for normal and Gamma distributions, exhibiting a greater ability for drift detection under biased and unbiased Average Run Lengths. This study offers valuable insights into enhancing manufacturing quality through effectively implementing and comparing Shewhart, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, and CUSUM charts. By evaluating their performance under various conditions and comparing them with other control chart methods, this research provides valuable guidance for industries seeking to improve process monitoring and product quality. It is essential to acknowledge that the findings are based on specific experimental conditions and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world manufacturing environments. For practical purposes, the suggested charts are also applied to real-world case studies, including air quality (focusing on five metal oxide chemistry sensors: carbon monoxide concentration, non-metonic hydrocarbons, benzene, total nitrogen oxides, and nitrogen dioxide) and maintenance data (including air temperature, rotating speed, and equipment failure).

In this phase models must process through streams of data that can evolve over time and distort the relationship between incoming data, causing concept drift. This paper proposes leveraging the advantages of emerging features stores in order to improve concept drift detection on unlabeled, dynamic data streams across multiple models. Firstly, we introduce Drift Detection on Distributed Datasets (QuaD), which combines classical drift detectors to make use of labeled and unlabeled data, and create local context (i.e. per live model) and global context (i.e. across multiple models). Secondly, we propose using feature store entities, SHAP values, and Collaborative Filtering (CF) to augment unlabeled data across multiple models. To the best of our knowledge, QuaD is the first work that examines the collective behavior of concept drift across multiple models and discerns associations between models that may share a susceptibility in a dynamic setting. QuaD uses a combination of performance-based and data distribution-based drift detectors and CF to capture varying types of concept drifts for labeled and unlabeled data streams and is modeled around the data abstraction provided by emerging feature stores.","INCLUDE","Relevant (Score: 3.0): CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift","3","CORE: Infrastructure/Configuration drift","2022","Not available","Here's a structured summary based on the provided metadata:

In this article, based on Riemannian manifolds and statistical process control, we propose a novel online algorithm for the concept drift detection of time series. Using the online segmentations with multiple sliding windows, phase space reconstruction of time series is implemented, based on which multi-scale features of series data are calculated. By means of information geometry theory, the obtained features are projected into Riemannian manifolds for the evading of noise interference and structural redundancy in the time series. Finally, with statistical process control, the detection of concept drifts is implemented.

Multi-cloud environments, which involve the use of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs), offer businesses the flexibility to optimize performance, improve resource allocation, and mitigate risks such as downtime, vendor lock-in, and service interruptions. This review explores the design principles and best practices for creating multi-cloud architectures that enhance enterprise scalability while simultaneously driving cost efficiencies. By leveraging the strengths of various CSPs such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud businesses can tailor their infrastructure to meet specific workload requirements and capitalize on competitive pricing models, ensuring better resource utilization and reducing the risk of under or over-provisioning. Scalability in multi-cloud architectures is achieved by implementing load balancing, auto-scaling, and failover mechanisms across multiple platforms. These systems can dynamically allocate resources in response to fluctuating demand, ensuring high availability and optimized performance. Additionally, the review discusses the key technologies that enable multi-cloud management, such as cloud management platforms (CMPs), containerization, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, which help streamline operations and simplify the complex task of managing resources across disparate cloud environments. Cost reduction in multi-cloud is achieved by optimizing resource usage, selecting the right pricing models (e.g., on-demand, reserved, or spot pricing), and automating scaling and resource management. The review also highlights the importance of adopting security best practices to manage data privacy and compliance across multiple clouds. Finally, the review presents real-world case studies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of multi-cloud strategies, illustrating how enterprises can scale operations effectively while reducing infrastructure costs. This research underscores the transformative potential of multi-cloud architectures in modern enterprise environments, emphasizing their role in achieving business agility, cost optimization, and operational efficiency.

However, the dynamic and distributed nature of lakehouses introduces significant governance challenges, particularly in ensuring continuous compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks. This paper proposes a novel DevSecOps Policy-as-Code (PaC) model tailored for lakehouse environments that automates compliance enforcement across data ingestion, transformation, storage, and consumption layers. By integrating declarative policy definitions into CI/CD pipelines, the model enables real-time policy validation and enforcement through a centralized policy registry and a powerful policy engine. It supports multiple enforcement stages, pre-deployment checks, runtime validations, and periodic audits, while generating comprehensive, automated audit logs to ensure traceability and accountability. The architecture facilitates seamless integration with leading lakehouse platforms such as Databricks, Delta Lake, and Apache Iceberg, and automates security controls including role-based and attribute-based access management, secrets handling, and encryption enforcement. Observability features provide continuous monitoring of compliance posture, alerting mechanisms, and remediation workflows, transforming compliance from a static checkpoint to a dynamic, continuous process. This approach reduces manual overhead, mitigates risk, and fosters a compliance-first culture within agile data teams. The paper concludes by discussing practical implications for enterprise data governance and outlining future research directions, including semantic policy modeling, AI-enhanced compliance analytics, and multi-cloud policy harmonization.

 Process mining provides techniques to learn models from event data. These models can be descriptive (e.g., Petri nets) or predictive (e.g., neural networks). The learned models offer operational support to process owners by conformance checking, process enhancement, or predictive monitoring. However, processes are frequently subject to significant changes, making the learned models outdated and less valuable over time. To tackle this problem,
 Process Concept Drift
 (PCD) detection techniques are employed. By identifying when the process changes occur, one can replace learned models by relearning, updating, or discounting pre-drift knowledge. Various techniques to detect PCDs have been proposed. However, each technique's evaluation focuses on different evaluation goals out of accuracy, latency, versatility, scalability, parameter sensitivity, and robustness. Furthermore, the employed evaluation techniques and data sets differ. Since many techniques are not evaluated against more than one other technique, this lack of comparability raises one question:
 How do PCD detection techniques compare against each other?
 With this paper, we propose, implement, and apply a unified evaluation framework for PCD detection. We do this by collecting evaluation goals and evaluation techniques together with data sets. We derive a representative sample of techniques from a taxonomy for PCD detection. The implemented techniques and proposed evaluation framework are provided in a publicly available repository. We present the results of our experimental evaluation and observe that none of the implemented techniques works well across all evaluation goals. However, the results indicate future improvement points of algorithms and guide practitioners.

Patterns in such data stream problems may change quickly. Consequently, machine learning models that operate in this context must be updated over time. This phenomenon is called concept drift in machine learning and data mining literature. Several different directions have been pursued to learn from data stream and to deal with concept drift. However, most drift detection methods consider that an instance's class label is available right after its prediction, since these methods work by monitoring the prediction results of a base classifier or an ensemble of classifiers. Nevertheless, this constraint is unrealistic in several practical problems. To cope with this constraint, some works are focused on proposing efficient unsupervised or semi-supervised concept drift detectors. While interesting and recent overview papers dedicated to supervised drift detectors have been published, the scenario is not the same in terms of unsupervised methods.

Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels.

We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification.

A lot of research on concept drift has focused on the supervised case that assumes the true labels of supervised tasks are available immediately after making predictions. Controlling for false positives while monitoring the performance of predictive models used to make inference from extremely large datasets periodically, where the true labels are not instantly available, becomes extremely challenging. We propose a flexible and efficient concept drift detection algorithm that uses classical statistical process control in a label-less setting to accurately detect concept drifts.
