Listing 1 is …","Modern DevOps organizations require a high degree of automation to achieve software stability at frequent changes. Further, there is a need for flexible, timely reconfiguration of the infrastructure, e.g., to use pay-per-use infrastructure efficiently based on application load. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the DevOps tool to automate infrastructure. However, modern static IaC solutions only support infrastructures that are deployed and do not change afterward. To implement infrastructures that change dynamically over time, static IaC programs have to be (updated and) re-run, e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline, or configure an external orchestrator that implements the dynamic behavior, e.g., an autoscaler or Kubernetes operator. Both do not capture the dynamic behavior in the IaC program and prevent analyzing and testing the infrastructure configuration jointly with its dynamic behavior. To fill this gap, we envision dynamic IaC, which augments static IaC with the ability to define dynamic behavior within the IaC program. In contrast to static IaC programs, dynamic IaC programs run continuously. They re-evaluate program parts that depend on external signals when these change and automatically adjust the infrastructure accordingly. We implement DIaC as the first dynamic IaC solution and demonstrate it in two realistic use cases of broader relevance. With dynamic IaC, ensuring the program’s correctness is even harder than for static IaC because programs may define many target configurations in contrast to only a few. However, for this reason, it is also more critical. To solve this issue, we propose automated, specialized property-based testing for IaC programs and implement it in ProTI."

From a maintenance and evolution perspective, the topic has picked the interest of practitioners and academics alike, given the relative scarcity of supporting patterns, best practices, tools, and software engineering techniques. Using the data coming from 44 semistructured interviews to senior developers of as many companies, in this paper we shed light on the state of the practice in the adoption of IaC and the key software engineering challenges in the field. Particularly, we investigate (i) how practitioners adopt and develop IaC, (ii) which support is currently available, i.e., the typically used tools and their advantages/disadvantages, and (iii) what are the practitioner's needs when dealing with IaC development, maintenance, and evolution. Our findings clearly highlight the need for more research in the field: the support provided by currently available tools is still limited, and developers feel the need of novel techniques for testing and maintaining IaC code."

Instead, IT organizations heavily rely on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies, to automate the provisioning, configuration, and maintenance of computing infrastructures and systems. IaC systems typically offer declarative, domain-specific languages (DSLs) that allow system administrators and developers to write high-level programs that specify the desired state of their infrastructure in a reliable, predictable, and documented fashion. Just like traditional programs, IaC software is not immune to faults, with issues ranging from deployment failures to critical misconfigurations that often impact production systems used by millions of end users. Surprisingly, despite its crucial role in global infrastructure management, the tooling and techniques for ensuring IaC reliability still have room for improvement. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 360 bugs identified in IaC software within prominent IaC ecosystems including Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. Our work is the first in-depth exploration of bug characteristics in these widely-used IaC environments. Through our analysis we aim to understand: (1) how these bugs manifest, (2) their underlying root causes, (3) their reproduction requirements in terms of system state (e.g., operating system versions) or input characteristics, and (4) how these bugs are fixed. Based on our findings, we evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques for IaC reliability, identify their limitations, and provide a set of recommendations for future research. We believe that our study helps researchers to (1) better understand the complexity and peculiarities of IaC software, and (2) develop advanced tooling for more reliable and robust system configurations.

Despite reported benefits, IaC scripts are susceptible to defects. Defects in IaC scripts can cause serious consequences, for example, creating large-scale outages similar to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) incident in 2017. The prevalence of defects in IaC scripts necessitates practitioners to implement IaC testing and be aware of IaC testing practices. A synthesis of IaC testing practices can enable practitioners in early mitigation of IaC defects and also help researchers to identify potential research avenues. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by identifying a set of testing practices for IaC scripts. We apply open coding on 50 Internet artifacts, such as blog posts to derive IaC testing practices. We identify six testing practices that include behavior-focused test coverage, the practice of measuring coverage of IaC test cases in terms of expected behavior. We conclude our paper by discussing how practitioners and researchers can leverage our derived list of testing practices for IaC."

Despite wide adoption, developing and maintaining high-quality IaC artifacts is still challenging. This paper proposes an approach to handling the fine-grained and frequently occurring IaC code errors. The approach extracts code changes from historical commits and clusters them into groups, by constructing a feature model of code changes and employing an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It identifies error patterns from the clusters and proposes a set of inspection rules to check the potential IaC code errors. In practice, we take Puppet code artifacts as subject objects and perform a comprehensive study on 14 popular Puppet artifacts. In our experiment, we get 41 cross-artifact error patterns, covering 42% crawled code changes. Based on these patterns, 30 rules are proposed, covering 60% identified error patterns, to proactively check IaC artifacts. The approach would be helpful in improving code quality of IaC artifacts."

Additionally, our study found that the majority of the tools and techniques are developed for infrastructure provisioning, rather than configuration management and image building. This raises concerns because configuring software is a high-risk task, with malicious actors constantly targeting software systems. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers to develop efficient and advanced techniques for detecting defects in configuration management and image building.

At the same time, operators are expected to update and keep production systems stable at all times. To overcome the development–operations barrier, organizations have started to adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to efficiently deploy middleware and applications using automation scripts. These automations comprise a series of steps that should be idempotent to guarantee repeatability and convergence. Rigorous testing is required to ensure that the system idempotently converges to a desired state, starting from arbitrary states. We propose and evaluate a model-based testing framework for IaC. An abstracted system model is utilized to derive state transition graphs, based on which we systematically generate test cases for the automation. The test cases are executed in light-weight virtual machine environments. Our prototype targets one popular IaC tool (Chef), but the approach is general. We apply our framework to a large base of public IaC scripts written by operators, showing that it correctly detects non-idempotent automations."

As setups can be complex, developers implement IaC programs in general-purpose programming languages like TypeScript and Python, using PL-IaC solutions like Pulumi and AWS CDK. The reliability of such IaC programs is even more relevant than in traditional software because a bug in IaC impacts the whole system. Yet, even though testing is a standard development practice, it is rarely used for IaC programs. For instance, in August 2022, less than 1% of the public Pulumi IaC programs on GitHub implemented tests. Available IaC program testing techniques severely limit the development velocity or require much development effort. <p xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">To solve these issues, we propose Automated Configuration Testing (ACT), a methodology to test IaC programs in many configurations quickly and with low effort.

We implement ACT in <b>ProTI</b>, a testing tool for Pulumi TypeScript with a type-based generator and oracle, and support for application specifications. Our evaluation with 6 081 programs from GitHub and artificial benchmarks shows that <b>ProTI</b> can directly be applied to existing IaC programs, quickly finds bugs where current techniques are infeasible, and enables reusing existing generators and oracles thanks to its pluggable architecture.
