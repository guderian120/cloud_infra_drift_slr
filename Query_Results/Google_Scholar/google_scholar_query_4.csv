The need for IT agility and organizational scalability creates a problematic situation for managing various cloud environments. The document investigates detailed automation solutions for multi-cloud deployments integrating Terraform with Ansible and Kubernetes. Organizations achieve better business response capabilities by combining these strong automation tools, optimizing deployment streamlining while managing resources better and minimizing operational expenses. The primary function of Terraform is to provide an automation framework backbone that enables IaC infrastructure provisioning. Users can deploy cloud infrastructure consistently and repeatedly through Terraform because they define resources in declarative codes that work across major cloud providers. The ability to streamline cloud management across multiple platforms becomes more effective through this feature when operating in a multi-cloud environment. The automation process reaches a higher degree of robustness when using Ansible alongside its configuration management and application deployment capabilities. With a structure that needs no agent, Ansible provides users with straightforward orchestration processes between different platforms, ensuring they can easily manage their resources regardless of their cloud provider types. With its fundamental capabilities to orchestrate containers, Kubernetes plays a crucial role in a multi-cloud environment. It enables the deployment and management of applications, thereby automating application deployment and management for enterprise organizations. This results in consistent and reliable execution across various cloud systems. Developers can create an automated workflow connecting infrastructure provisioning to application deployment processes. This end-to-end automation framework significantly improves operational efficiency, reduces product delivery schedules, and helps organizations develop a robust cloud strategy, enhancing market competitiveness.

What is hardly disputed is that what is alterable in science is of mere ephemeral value; and what is valuable in it is that which is more universal and permanent, that which is more solid and lasting. One of the very few philosophers who oppose this accepted view is Sir Karl Popper. In his view, science is so valuable because of its open- mindedness, because any of its achievements may at any time be given up and newer achievements may be hoped for to replace the relinquished ones. Science, says Popper, is at constant war with itself, and it progresses by revolutions and internal conflicts."

Kubernetes largely targets the cloud environment but new use cases require performant, available and scalable orchestration at the edge. Kubernetes stores all cluster state in etcd, a strongly consistent key-value store. We find that at larger etcd cluster sizes, offering higher availability, write request latency significantly increases and throughput decreases similarly. Coupled with approximately 30% of Kubernetes requests being writes, this directly impacts the request latency and availability of Kubernetes, reducing its suitability for the edge. We revisit the requirement of strong consistency and propose an eventually consistent approach instead. This enables higher performance, availability and scalability whilst still supporting the broad needs of Kubernetes. This aims to make Kubernetes much more suitable for performance-critical, dynamically-scaled edge solutions."

The field is rooted in the Sun's photosphere, where it has been observed for many years. Global maps of the solar magnetic field based on full disk magnetograms are commonly used as boundary conditions for coronal and solar wind models. Two primary observational constraints on the models are (1) the open field regions in the model should approximately correspond to coronal holes observed in emission, and (2) the magnitude of the open magnetic flux in the model should match that inferred from in situ spacecraft measurements. In this study, we calculate both MHD and PFSS solutions using fourteen different magnetic maps produced from five different types of observatory magnetograms, for the time period surrounding July, 2010. We have found that for all of the model/map combinations, models that have coronal hole areas close to observations underestimate the interplanetary magnetic flux, or, conversely, for models to match the interplanetary flux, the modeled open field regions are larger than coronal holes observed in EUV emission. In an alternative approach, we estimate the open magnetic flux entirely from solar observations by combining automatically detected coronal holes for Carrington rotation 2098 with observatory synoptic magnetic maps. This approach also underestimates the interplanetary magnetic flux. Our results imply that either typical observatory maps underestimate the Sun's magnetic flux, or a significant portion of the open magnetic flux is not rooted in regions that are obviously dark in EUV and X-ray emission."

Container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, which has become the de facto standard, simplify the deployment of container-based applications. However, developing efficient and well-defined orchestration systems is a challenge. This article focuses specifically on the scheduler, a key orchestrator task that assigns physical resources to containers. Scheduling approaches are designed based on different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to provide limited response time, efficient energy consumption, better resource utilization, and other things. This article aims to establish insight knowledge into Kubernetes scheduling, find the main gaps, and thus guide future research in the area. Therefore, we conduct a study of empirical research on Kubernetes scheduling techniques and present a new taxonomy for Kubernetes scheduling. The challenges, future direction, and research opportunities are also discussed."

High-performance computing, advanced networking solutions, and resource optimization strategies can help data centers maintain the speed and efficiency necessary to provide high-quality cloud services. Running containerized applications is one such optimization strategy, offering benefits such as improved portability, enhanced security, better resource utilization, faster deployment and scaling, and improved integration and interoperability. These benefits can help organizations improve their application deployment and management, enabling them to respond more quickly and effectively to dynamic business needs. Kubernetes is a container orchestration system designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. One of its key features is the ability to schedule the deployment and execution of containers across a cluster of nodes using a scheduling algorithm. This algorithm determines the best placement of containers on the available nodes in the cluster. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of various scheduling algorithms in the context of Kubernetes. We characterize and group them into four sub-categories: generic scheduling, multi-objective optimization-based scheduling, AI-focused scheduling, and autoscaling enabled scheduling, and identify gaps and issues that require further research.
