Nevertheless, the unceasing growth of the cloud market is posing hard challenges on its participants. On the provider side, the capability of orchestrating resources in order to maximise profits without failing customers’ expectations is a matter of concern. On the customer side, the efficient resource selection from a plethora of similar services advertised by a multitude of providers is an open question. In such a multi-cloud landscape, several research initiatives advocate the employment of software frameworks (namely, cloud resource orchestration frameworks - CROFs) capable of orchestrating the heterogeneous resources offered by a multitude of cloud providers in a way that best suits the customer’s need. The objective of this paper is to provide the reader with a systematic review and comparison of the most relevant CROFs found in the literature, as well as to highlight the multi-cloud computing open issues that need to be addressed by the research community in the near future."

Containerization in multi-cloud environments has received significant attention in recent years both from academic research and industrial development perspectives. However, there exists no effort to systematically investigate the state of research on this topic. The aim of this research is to systematically identify and categorize the multiple aspects of container utilization in multi-cloud environment. We conduct the Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) on the literature published between January 2013 and March 2023. Eighty-six studies were finally selected and the key results are: (1) Four leading themes on cloud computing and network systems research were identified: 'Scalability and High Availability', 'Performance and Optimization', 'Security and Privacy', and 'Multi-Cloud Container Monitoring and Adaptation'. (2) Seventy-four patterns and strategies for containerization in multi-cloud environment were classified across 10 subcategories and 4 categories. (3) Ten quality attributes considered were identified with 47 associated tactics. (4) Four distinct frameworks were introduced based on the analysis of identified challenges and solutions: a security challenge-solution framework, an automation challenge-solution framework, a deployment challenge-solution framework, and a monitoring challenge-solution framework. The results of this SMS will assist researchers and practitioners in pursuing further studies on containerization in multi-cloud environment and developing specialized solutions for challenges related to containerization applications in multi-cloud environment."

Currently, there are multiple solutions available in the market with limited success due to hidden drawbacks, for instance, vendor-lock-in, portability issues in migration, security threats and expensive in the long run and also, unfortunately, interoperability standardization is still work in progress. In this paper, we explore few hybrid/multi cloud use cases and demonstrate how these can be accomplished with our Federated Cloud Services Framework (middleware), which is built upon OpenStack [5], an open source cloud and by leveraging existing OpenStack functionalities."

Their role spans both vertically (deployment on infrastructure, platform, application and microservice levels) and horizontally (deployments from many distinct cloud resource providers). However, despite the central role of orchestration, the popular orchestration frameworks lack mechanisms to provide security guarantees for cloud operators. In this work, we analyze the security landscape of cloud orchestration frameworks for multi-cloud infrastructure. We identify a set of attack scenarios, define security enforcement enablers and propose an architecture for a security-enabled cloud orchestration framework for multi-cloud application deployments."

In this paper, we present a model-driven approach based on Feature Models (FMs) originating from Software Product Lines (SPL) to handle cloud variability and then manage and create cloud configurations. We combine it with ontologies, used to model the various semantics of cloud systems. The approach takes into consideration application technical requirements as well as non-functional ones to provide a set of valid cloud or multi-cloud configurations and is implemented in a framework named SALOON."

However, although many providers offer specific tools for HA support, like floating IPs and load balancing, the analysis of downtime at public cloud providers in previous years shows that a combination of several availability zones or cloud providers is required to achieve “five nines” availability. Besides reducing the chances of failure, the use of multiple availability zones and geographically distributed clouds may additionally bring performance and cost benefits. However, the orchestration, in an efficient and adaptive way, of HA multi-tier services in multi-zone and multi-cloud environments brings several challenges. This paper presents a novel orchestration method to automate the deployment and management of high availability multi-tier services on multiple availability zones, by introducing new affinity mechanisms, such as VM to location and role to role affinity/anti-affinity rules. Furthermore, we also extend this solution to multi-cloud scenarios, based on the replication or distribution of the service components among various clouds, along with their corresponding affinity rules."

Clouds are typically online, on-demand, and off-premise/on-premise. There are public, private, and community Clouds in plenty to comfortably cater to different regions and requirements. There is a number of purpose-specific Cloud environments catering to different communities. Precisely speaking, there are environment-specific, organization-wide, business-centric, private, and localized Clouds comprising bare metal servers, virtual machines, and containers. In the recent past, there are edge or fog device Clouds emerging an evolving fast with the maturity and stability of edge or fog computing. That is, multi-faceted devices are being meticulously clubbed together to form powerful and pioneering device Clouds to attend environment-specific and time-sensitive tasks. On the other hand, there are massive public Clouds by various providers to meet their clients’ computing, networking, and storage needs. Thus, the Cloud evolution and revolution are definitely and decisively amazing. The next innovation, disruption, and transformation in this mesmerizing journey is to form and leverage hybrid Clouds. Many kinds of distributed Cloud environments are to be connected with one another to achieve bigger and better things for the IT, which is invariably mandated to do more with less. This chapter is dedicated to conveying what and why hybrid Clouds and how the hybrid Cloud management tasks are being meticulously accomplished through integrated management tools."

As a result, this integration must come with several pulls that have to be dealt with to realize proper implementation. This paper seeks to identify the major issues of implementing AI and coming up with the best solutions in multi-cloud infrastructures. Firstly, compatibility problems appear as a fundamental issue in the process of implementing AI across more than one cloud. Every cloud provider uses different APIs, formats for data, and possibilities to configure the infrastructure that hinders data and services integration. To counter this, there is a need to have the compliance that comes in terms of standard development through the use of data formats, APIs, and interoperability frameworks. Furthermore, features such as Docker and Kubernetes make the work with ports lighter and let the AI components smoothly interconnect regardless of the used cloud environment. Secondly, data management as well as the governance of big data serve up significant challenges for multi-cloud AI implementation. Legal requirements concerning data privacy, global compliance standards, as well as data sovereignty concerns call for strong governance of cloud data to ensure they are accurate, secure, as well as compliant in the required cloud settings. These risks must be addressed, nonetheless, to build trust in the multi-cloud AI utilization; in this regard, robust data management, encompassing data encryption, access privileges, as well as data auditing, can be implemented in organizational settings. In addition, the optimization of performance is another significant issue to consider as AI computational tasks may be executed across different cloud environments resulting in increased throughput time and network congestion and contention. Through auto-scaling and workload scheduling algorithms used in orchestration, resources can be effectively allocated and loaded in the heterogeneous cloud infrastructures in the most efficient and optimum way thus reducing operational costs. The other is achieving robustness and dependability of multi-cloud AI applications. It is an immutable fact that one can always imagine a situation when clouds, networks, or hardware will fail; therefore, specific measures should be taken to ensure the availability and reliability of the system. The TCP/IP model also classes the means used for implementing redundant mechanisms, data replication strategies and disaster recovery protocols in different geographically situated cloud regions that improve the dependable computing system’s resources.

Application deployment in particular is a noteworthy feature to be evaluated as microservices become mainstream in adoption. Especially so when considered jointly with orchestration services; indeed OpenStack, as the most widely adopted Cloud middleware among the OpenSource community, features an orchestration subsystem, and may orchestrate the deployment of applications and services. In this work the authors will describe an architecture, developed within the H2020 BEACON project, for a standardized approach to orchestrated application deployment in multi-Cloud OpenStack- based setups, with TOSCA providing the specifications."
