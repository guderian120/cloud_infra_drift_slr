In this work we study the problem of learning when the distribution that generate the examples changes over time. We present a method for detection of changes in the probability distribution of examples. The idea behind the drift detection method is to control the online error-rate of the algorithm. The training examples are presented in sequence. When a new training example is available, it is classified using the actual model. Statistical theory guarantees that while the distribution is stationary, the error will decrease. When the distribution changes, the error will increase. The method controls the trace of the online error of the algorithm. For the actual context we define a warning level, and a drift level. A new context is declared, if in a sequence of examples, the error increases reaching the warning level at example k w , and the drift level at example k d . This is an indication of a change in the distribution of the examples. The algorithm learns a new model using only the examples since k w . The method was tested with a set of eight artificial datasets and a real world dataset. We used three learning algorithms: a perceptron, a neural network and a decision tree. The experimental results show a good performance detecting drift and with learning the new concept. We also observe that the method is independent of the learning algorithm."

 Process mining provides techniques to learn models from event data. These models can be descriptive (e.g., Petri nets) or predictive (e.g., neural networks). The learned models offer operational support to process owners by conformance checking, process enhancement, or predictive monitoring. However, processes are frequently subject to significant changes, making the learned models outdated and less valuable over time. To tackle this problem,
 Process Concept Drift
 (PCD) detection techniques are employed. By identifying when the process changes occur, one can replace learned models by relearning, updating, or discounting pre-drift knowledge. Various techniques to detect PCDs have been proposed. However, each technique's evaluation focuses on different evaluation goals out of accuracy, latency, versatility, scalability, parameter sensitivity, and robustness. Furthermore, the employed evaluation techniques and data sets differ. Since many techniques are not evaluated against more than one other technique, this lack of comparability raises one question:
 How do PCD detection techniques compare against each other?
 With this paper, we propose, implement, and apply a unified evaluation framework for PCD detection. We do this by collecting evaluation goals and evaluation techniques together with data sets. We derive a representative sample of techniques from a taxonomy for PCD detection. The implemented techniques and proposed evaluation framework are provided in a publicly available repository. We present the results of our experimental evaluation and observe that none of the implemented techniques works well across all evaluation goals. However, the results indicate future improvement points of algorithms and guide practitioners.

Patterns in such data stream problems may change quickly. Consequently, machine learning models that operate in this context must be updated over time. This phenomenon is called concept drift in machine learning and data mining literature. Several different directions have been pursued to learn from data stream and to deal with concept drift. However, most drift detection methods consider that an instance's class label is available right after its prediction, since these methods work by monitoring the prediction results of a base classifier or an ensemble of classifiers. Nevertheless, this constraint is unrealistic in several practical problems. To cope with this constraint, some works are focused on proposing efficient unsupervised or semi-supervised concept drift detectors. While interesting and recent overview papers dedicated to supervised drift detectors have been published, the scenario is not the same in terms of unsupervised methods. Therefore, this work presents a comprehensive overview of approaches that tackle concept drift in classification problems in an unsupervised manner. Additional contribution includes a proposed taxonomy of state-of-the-art approaches for concept drift detection based on unsupervised strategies.

This problem is aggravated when the drift is gradual over time. In this work we deflne a method for detecting concept drift, even in the case of slow gradual change. It is based on the estimated distribution of the distances between classiflcation errors. The proposed method can be used with any learning algorithm in two ways: using it as a wrapper of a batch learning algorithm or implementing it inside an incremental and online algorithm. The experimentation results compare our method (EDDM) with a similar one (DDM). Latter uses the error-rate instead of distance-error-rate."

The statistical theory offers rank-based statistics for this task. However, these statistics depend on a fixed set of characteristics of the underlying distribution. Thus, they work well whenever the change in the underlying distribution affects the properties measured by the statistic, but they perform not very well, if the drift influences the characteristics caught by the test statistic only to a small degree. To address this problem, we show how uniform convergence bounds in learning theory can be adjusted for adaptive concept drift detection. In particular, we present three novel drift detection tests, whose test statistics are dynamically adapted to match the actual data at hand. The first one is based on a rank statistic on density estimates for a binary representation of the data, the second compares average margins of a linear classifier induced by the 1-norm support vector machine (SVM), and the last one is based on the average zero-one, sigmoid or stepwise linear error rate of an SVM classifier. We compare these new approaches with the maximum mean discrepancy method, the StreamKrimp system, and the multivariate Wald–Wolfowitz test. The results indicate that the new methods are able to detect concept drift reliably and that they perform favorably in a precision-recall analysis. Copyright © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An open challenge is the visual analysis of drift phenomena when processes change over time. In this paper, we address this research gap. Our contribution is a system for fine-granular process drift detection and corresponding visualizations for event logs of executed business processes. We evaluated our system both on synthetic and real-world data. On synthetic logs, we achieved an average F-score of 0.96 and outperformed all the state-of-the-art methods. On real-world logs, we identified all types of process drifts in a comprehensive manner. Finally, we conducted a user study highlighting that our visualizations are easy to use and useful as perceived by process mining experts. In this way, our work contributes to research on process mining, event sequence analysis, and visualization of temporal data."

Drift Detection Method (DDM) is a simple, efficient, well-known method whose performance is often impaired when the concepts are very long. This article proposes the Reactive Drift Detection Method (RDDM) , which is based on DDM and, among other modifications, discards older instances of very long concepts aiming to detect drifts earlier, improving the final accuracy. Experiments run in MOA, using abrupt and gradual concept drift versions of different dataset generators and sizes (48 artificial datasets in total), as well as three real-world datasets, suggest RDDM beats the accuracy results of DDM, ECDD, and STEPD in most scenarios."

The method can be used as a wrapper over any learning algorithm. In most problems, a change affects only some regions of the instance space, not the instance space as a whole. In decision models that fit different functions to regions of the instance space, like Decision Trees and Rule Learners, the method can be used to monitor the error in regions of the instance space, with advantages of fast model adaptation. In this work we present experiments using the method as a wrapper over a decision tree and a linear model, and in each internal-node of a decision tree. The experimental results obtained in controlled experiments using artificial data and a real-world problem show a good performance detecting drift and in adapting the decision model to the new concept."

The technique is designed to analyze requirements specifications expressed in the SCR (Software Cost Reduction) tabular notation. As background, the SCR approach to specifying requirements is reviewed. To provide a formal semantics for the SCR notation and a foundation for consistency checking, a formal requirements model is introduced; the model represents a software system as a finite-state automation which produces externally visible outputs in response to changes in monitored environmental quantities. Results of two experiments are presented which evaluated the utility and scalability of our technique for consistency checking in real-world avionics application. The role of consistency checking during the requirements phase of software development is discussed."

Yet, tools are not capable of keeping up with the engineers' rate of model changes. This paper presents an approach for quickly, correctly, and automatically deciding what consistency rules to evaluate when a model changes. The approach does not require consistency rules with special annotations. Instead, it treats consistency rules as black-box entities and observes their behavior during their evaluation to identify what model elements they access. The UML/Analyzer tool, integrated with IBM Rational Rose™, fully implements this approach. It was used to evaluate 29 models with tens-of-thousands of model elements, evaluated on 24 types of consistency rules over 140,000 times. We found that the approach provided design feedback correctly and required, in average, less than 9ms evaluation time per model change with a worst case of less than 2 seconds at the expense of a linearly increasing memory need. This is a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art."

Concept drift makes the learning process complicated because of the inconsistency between existing data and upcoming data. Since concept drift was first proposed, numerous articles have been published to address this issue in terms of distribution analysis. However, most distributionbased drift detection methods assume that a drift happens at an exact time point, and the data arrived before that time point is considered not important. Thus, if a drift only occurs in a small region of the entire feature space, the other non-drifted regions may also be suspended, thereby reducing the learning efficiency of models. To retrieve nondrifted information from suspended historical data, we propose a local drift degree (LDD) measurement that can continuously monitor regional density changes. Instead of suspending all historical data after a drift, we synchronize the regional density discrepancies according to LDD. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark data sets show that our concept drift adaptation algorithm improves accuracy compared to other methods."

In this context, the target function may change over time, an inherent problem of online learning (known as concept drift). In order to handle concept drift regardless of the learning model, we propose new methods to monitor the performance metrics measured during the learning process, to trigger drift signals when a significant variation has been detected. To monitor this performance, we apply some probability inequalities that assume only independent, univariate and bounded random variables to obtain theoretical guarantees for the detection of such distributional changes. Some common restrictions for the online change detection as well as relevant types of change (abrupt and gradual) are considered. Two main approaches are proposed, the first one involves moving averages and is more suitable to detect abrupt changes. The second one follows a widespread intuitive idea to deal with gradual changes using weighted moving averages. The simplicity of the proposed methods, together with the computational efficiency make them very advantageous. We use a Naive Bayes classifier and a Perceptron to evaluate the performance of the methods over synthetic and real data."

Detecting drift as soon as possible and identifying the process elements involved, lead to a much better understanding of the process behavior, which can be a competitive edge for businesses. However, most existing approaches focus on each of these two tasks separately. Isolated approaches do not always have interfaces between them that allow you to combine solutions effectively for each corresponding task. In such cases, using the two isolated solutions together is neither feasible nor even useful from the point of view of a business analyst. This paper proposes an integrated approach to detect and locate concept drifts based on an online setting for trace clustering. Experiments with synthetic event logs with different types of control-flow changes showed that concept drifts can be detected and located efficiently."
