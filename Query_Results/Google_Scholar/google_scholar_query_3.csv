This procedure offers several performance benefits over traditional designs based on the periodic measurement of standards to diagnose and correct for variation in instrument response. Using repeated measurements of every sample as a drift diagnostic, as opposed to requiring the periodic measurement of any given sample or standard, the analyst can better budget the measurement time to be devoted to each sample, distributing it to optimize the uncertainty of the analytical result. The drift is diagnosed from the repeated measurements, a model of the instrument response drift is constructed, and the data are corrected to a “drift-free” condition. This drift-free condition allows data to be accumulated over long periods of time with little or no loss in precision due to drift. More than 10-fold precision enhancements of analytical atomic emission results hav..."

This article …","This article discusses the current developments and advances for the incorporation of a damage repair mechanism in composite materials. There are several approaches for imparting this functionality, but each approach can be described as belonging to one of two broad families, an active-phase mechanism or an active-matrix mechanism. Active-phase mechanisms incorporate another phase into the composite material, besides reinforcement and matrix, to accomplish damage repair. Active-matrix self-healing materials seek to incorporate a fundamental chemical phenomenon, such as reversible bonds, that can perform damage repair. Each of these approaches is described in detail including both the manufacturing or synthesis techniques and the material characterization approaches that have been adopted to assess self-healing capability. A brief summary and outlook is also provided that describes the current challenges and maturity of the field.

The history and evolution of several self-repair systems is examined including nano-beam healing elements, passive self-healing, autonomic self-healing and ballistic self-repair. Self-healing mechanisms utilized in the design of these unusual materials draw much information from the related field of polymer–polymer interfaces and crack healing. The relationship of material damage to material healing is examined in a manner to provide an understanding of the kinetics and damage reversal processes necessary to impart self-healing characteristics. In self-healing systems, there are transitions from hard-to-soft matter in ballistic impact and solvent bonding and conversely, soft-to-hard matter transitions in high rate yielding materials and shear-thickening fluids. These transitions are examined in terms of a new theory of the glass transition and yielding, viz., the twinkling fractal theory of the hard-to-soft matter transition. Success in the design of self-healing materials has important consequences for material safety, product performance and enhanced fatigue lifetime."

These “living” reactive anionic species are not neutralized by ambient atmosphere exposure (are stable to water, oxygen, CO2) and promote thermally activated equilibration among different network isomers and cyclic oligomers. The cross-link density of these living networks can be controlled by the ratio of D4:bis-D4, and the density of active chain ends is determined from the initiator:monomer ratio.

This review outlines the recent advances in the field of self-healing polymers. The first part discusses thermodynamic requirements for self-healing networks in the context of conformation changes that contribute to the Gibbs free energy. The chain flexibility significantly contributes to the entropy changes, whereas the heat of reaction and the external energy input are the main contributors to enthalpy changes. The second part focuses on chemical reactions that lead to self-healing, and the primary classes are the covalent bonding, supramolecular assemblies, ionic interactions, chemo-mechanical self-healing, and shape memory polymers. The third part outlines recent advances using encapsulation, remote self-healing and the role of shape memory polymers. Recent developments in the field of self-healing polymers undeniably indicate that the main challenge will be the designing of high glass transition (Tg) functional materials, which also exhibit stimuli-responsive attributes. Build-in controllable hierarchical heterogeneousness at various length scales capable of remote self-healing by physical and chemical responses will be essential in designing future materials of the 21st century."

Frequency and phase drifts are a common problem in the acquisition of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data If not accounted for, frequency and phase drifts will result in artifactual broadening of spectral peaks, distortion of spectral lineshapes, and a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) We present herein a new method for estimating and correcting frequency and phase drifts in in vivo MRS data



Methods

We used a simple method of fitting each spectral average to a reference scan (often the first average in the series) in the time domain through adjustment of frequency and phase terms Due to the similarity with image registration, this method is referred to as “spectral registration” Using simulated data with known frequency and phase drifts, the performance of spectral registration was compared with two existing methods at various SNR levels



Results

Spectral registration performed well in comparison with the other methods tested in terms of both frequency and phase drift estimation



Conclusions

Spectral registration provides an effective method for frequency and phase drift correction It does not involve the collection of navigator echoes, and does not rely on any specific resonances, such as residual water or creatine, making it highly versatile Magn Reson Med 73:44–50, 2015 © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc"

In the composite, a microencapsulated healing agent and a solid chemical catalyst are dispersed within the polymer matrix phase. Healing is triggered by crack propagation through the microcapsules, which then release the healing agent into the crack plane. Subsequent exposure of the healing agent to the chemical catalyst initiates polymerization and bonding of the crack faces. Self-healing (autonomic healing) is demonstrated on width-tapered double cantilever beam fracture specimens in which a mid-plane delamination is introduced and then allowed to heal. Autonomic healing at room temperature yields as much as 45% recovery of virgin interlaminar fracture toughness, while healing at 80 °C increases the recovery to over 80%. The in situ kinetics of healing in structural composites is investigated in comparison to that of neat epoxy resin."

Besides this, other agents could work equally well or can contribute to the self healing …","Concrete can be considered as a kind of artificial rock with properties more or less similar to certain natural rocks. As it is strong, durable, and relatively cheap, concrete is, since almost two centuries, the most used construction material worldwide, which can easily be recognized as it has changed the physiognomy of rural areas. However, due to the heterogeneity of the composition of its principle components, cement, water, and a variety of aggregates, the properties of the final product can widely vary. The structural designer therefore must previously establish which properties are important for a specific application and must choose the correct composition of the concrete ingredients in order to ensure that the final product applies to the previously set standards. Concrete is typically characterized by a high-compressive strength, but unfortunately also by a rather low-tensile strength. However, through the application of steel or other material reinforcements, the latter can be compensated for as such reinforcements can take over tensile forces. Modern concrete is based on Portland cement, a hydraulic cement patented by Joseph Aspdin in the early 19th century. Already in Roman times hydraulic cements, made from burned limestone and volcanic earth, slowly replaced the widely used non-hydraulic cements, which were based on burned limestone as main ingredient. When limestone is burned (or “calcined”) at a temperature between 800 and 900◦C, a process that drives off bound carbon dioxide (CO2), lime (calcium oxide; CaO) is produced. Lime, when brought into contact with water, reacts to form portlandite (Ca(OH)2) which can further react with CO2, which in turn forms back into calcite (CaCO3), or limestone, the pre-burning starting material. However, a major drawback of this non-hydraulic cement is that it will not set under water and, moreover, its reaction products portlandite and limestone are relatively soluble, and thus will deteriorate rapidly in wet and/or acidic environments. In contrast, portland cement produces, upon reaction with water, a much harder and insoluble material that will also set under water. For portland cement production a source of calcium, silicon, aluminum, and iron is needed and therefore usually limestone, clay, some bauxite, and iron ore are burned in a kiln at temperatures up to 1, 500◦C. The cement clinker produced is mainly composed of the minerals alite (3CaO.SiO2), belite (2CaO.SiO2), aluminate (3CaO.Al2O3), and ferrite (4CaO.Al2O3.Fe2O3), which all yield specific hydration products with different characteristics upon reaction with water."

Human skin can, for example, autonomously heal from wounds of various degrees, allowing it to restore its mechanical and electrical properties. In contrast, human-made electronic devices degrade over time due to fatigue, corrosion or damage incurred during operation, leading to device failure. Self-healing chemistry has emerged in recent years as a promising method for constructing soft electronic materials that are mechanically robust and can self-repair. Here we review the development of self-healing electronic materials and examine how such materials can be used to fabricate self-healing electronic devices. We explore the potential new functionalities of self-healing electronic systems that would not typically be possible with conventional electronic systems and discuss the current challenges in delivering self-healing soft electronics for practical applications.

However, self-healing hydrogels generally either possess mechanically robust or rapid self-healing properties but not both. Hence, the development of a mechanically robust hydrogel material with autonomous self-healing on the time scale of seconds is yet to be fully realized. Here, the current advances in the development of autonomous self-healing hydrogels are reviewed. Specifically, methods to test self-healing efficiencies and recoveries, mechanisms of autonomous self-healing, and mechanically robust hydrogels are presented. The trends indicate that hydrogels that self-heal better also achieve self-healing faster, as compared to gels that only partially self-heal. Recommendations to guide future development of self-healing hydrogels are offered and the potential relevance of self-healing hydrogels to the exciting research areas of 3D/4D printing, soft robotics, and assisted health technologies is highlighted."

By …","The recent development of diffraction-unlimited far-field fluorescence microscopy has overcome the classical resolution limit of ~250 nm of conventional light microscopy by about a factor of ten. The improved resolution, however, reveals not only biological structures at an unprecedented resolution, but is also susceptible to sample drift on a much finer scale than previously relevant. Without correction, sample drift leads to smeared images with decreased resolution, and in the worst case to misinterpretation of the imaged structures. This poses a problem especially for techniques such as Fluorescence Photoactivation Localization Microscopy (FPALM/PALM) or Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), which often require minutes recording time. Here we discuss an approach that corrects for three-dimensional (3D) drift in images of fixed samples without the requirement for fiduciary markers or instrument modifications. Drift is determined by calculating the spatial cross-correlation function between subsets of localized particles imaged at different times. Correction down to ~5 nm precision is achieved despite the fact that different molecules are imaged in each frame. We demonstrate the performance of our drift correction algorithm with different simulated structures and analyze its dependence on particle density and localization precision. By imaging mitochondria with Biplane FPALM we show our algorithm's feasibility in a practical application."

In our approach, event-based software architectures are targeted because they offer significant benefits for run-time adaptation. Before an automated planning agent can decide how to repair a self-healing system, a significant infrastructure must be in place to support making the planned repair. Specifically, the self-healing system must be built using a framework that allows for run-time adaptation, there must be a language in which to express the repair plan, and there must be a reconfiguration agent that can execute the repair plan once it is created. In this paper, we present tools and methods that implement these infrastructure elements in the context of an overall architecture-based vision for building self-healing systems.

The appearance of small cracks (<300 µm in width) in concrete is almost unavoidable, not necessarily causing a risk of collapse for the structure, but surely impairing its functionality, accelerating its degradation, and diminishing its service life and sustainability. This review provides the state-of-the-art of recent developments of self-healing concrete, covering autogenous or intrinsic healing of traditional concrete followed by stimulated autogenous healing via use of mineral additives, crystalline admixtures or (superabsorbent) polymers, and subsequently autonomous self-healing mechanisms, i.e. via, application of micro-, macro-, or vascular encapsulated polymers, minerals,or bacteria. The (stimulated) autogenous mechanisms are generally limited to healing crack widths of about 100–150 µm. In contrast, most autonomous self-healing mechanisms can heal cracks of 300 µm, even sometimes up to more than 1 mm, and usually act faster. After explaining the basic concept for each self-healing technique, the most recent advances are collected, explaining the progress and current limitations, to provide insights toward the future developments. This review addresses the research needs required to removehindrances that limit market penetration of self-healing concrete technologies."
