"A study of the link between cosmic rays and clouds with a cloud chamber at the CERN PS","https://scispace.com/paper/http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0104048v1","2001","Preprint","","The Cloud Collaboration","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0104048v1","Recent satellite data have revealed a surprising correlation between galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity and the fraction of the Earth covered by clouds. If this correlation were to be established by a causal mechanism, it could provide a crucial step in understanding the long-sought mechanism connecting solar and climate variability. The Earth's climate seems to be remarkably sensitive to solar activity, but variations of the Sun's electromagnetic radiation appear to be too small to account for the observed climate variability. However, since the GCR intensity is strongly modulated by the solar wind, a GCR-cloud link may provide a sufficient amplifying mechanism. Moreover if this connection were to be confirmed, it could have profound consequences for our understanding of the solar contributions to the current global warming. The CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) project proposes to test experimentally the existence a link between cosmic rays and cloud formation, and to understand the microphysical mechanism. CLOUD plans to perform detailed laboratory measurements in a particle beam at CERN, where all the parameters can be precisely controlled and measured. The beam will pass through an expansion cloud chamber and a reactor chamber where the atmosphere is to be duplicated by moist air charged with selected aerosols and trace condensable vapours. An array of external detectors and mass spectrometers is used to analyse the physical and chemical characteristics of the aerosols and trace gases during beam exposure. Where beam effects are found, the experiment will seek to evaluate their significance in the atmosphere by incorporating them into aerosol and cloud models."

The increased level of abstraction makes vendor lock-in inherent to serverless computing, raising more concerns than previous cloud paradigms. Multi-cloud serverless is a promising emerging approach against vendor lock-in, yet multiple challenges must be overcome to tap its potential. First, we need to be aware of both the performance and cost of each FaaS provider. Second, a multi-cloud architecture must be proposed before deploying a multi-cloud workflow. Domain-specific serverless offerings must then be integrated into the multi-cloud architecture to improve performance or save costs. Moreover, dealing with serverless offerings from multiple providers is challenging. Finally, we require workload portability support for serverless multi-cloud.
  In this paper, we present a multi-cloud library for cross-serverless offerings. We develop the End Analysis System (EAS) to support comparison among public FaaS providers in terms of performance and cost. Moreover, we design proof-of-concept multi-cloud architectures with domain-specific serverless offerings to alleviate problems such as data gravity. Finally, we deploy workloads on these architectures to evaluate several public FaaS offerings."

Traditional scaling approaches typically rely on static thresholds and predefined rules, which are often inadequate for optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance in distributed and dynamic environments. This inefficiency hinders the adaptability and performance required in edge-cloud infrastructures, which can only be achieved through the newly proposed in-place scaling. To address this problem, we propose the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based In-place Scaling Engine (MARLISE) that enables seamless, dynamic, reactive control with in-place resource scaling. We develop our solution using two Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms: Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We analyze each version of the proposed MARLISE solution using dynamic workloads, demonstrating their ability to ensure low response times of microservices and scalability. Our results show that MARLISE-based approaches outperform heuristic method in managing resource elasticity while maintaining microservice response times and achieving higher resource efficiency."
"Modeling Operational Fairness of Hybrid Cloud Brokerage","https://scispace.com/paper/http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05078v1","2022","Preprint","","Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran
Santonu Sarkar","10.1109/CCGRID.2018.00083","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05078v1","Cloud service brokerage is an emerging technology that attempts to simplify the consumption and operation of hybrid clouds. Today's cloud brokers attempt to insulate consumers from the vagaries of multiple clouds. To achieve the insulation, the modern cloud broker needs to disguise itself as the end-provider to consumers by creating and operating a virtual data center construct that we call a meta-cloud, which is assembled on top of a set of participating supplier clouds. It is crucial for such a cloud broker to be considered a trusted partner both by cloud consumers and by the underpinning cloud suppliers. A fundamental tenet of brokerage trust is vendor neutrality. On the one hand, cloud consumers will be comfortable if a cloud broker guarantees that they will not be led through a preferred path. And on the other hand, cloud suppliers would be more interested in partnering with a cloud broker who promises a fair apportioning of client provisioning requests. Because consumer and supplier trust on a meta-cloud broker stems from the assumption of being agnostic to supplier clouds, there is a need for a test strategy that verifies the fairness of cloud brokerage. In this paper, we propose a calculus of fairness that defines the rules to determine the operational behavior of a cloud broker. The calculus uses temporal logic to model the fact that fairness is a trait that has to be ascertained over time; it is not a characteristic that can be judged at a per-request fulfillment level. Using our temporal calculus of fairness as the basis, we propose an algorithm to determine the fairness of a broker probabilistically, based on its observed request apportioning policies. Our model for the fairness of cloud broker behavior also factors in inter-provider variables such as cost divergence and capacity variance."

Cloud AI services are widely used to develop domain-specific applications with precise learning metrics. However, the underlying cloud AI services remain opaque on how the model produces the prediction. We argue that XAI operations are accessible as open APIs to enable the consolidation of the XAI operations into the cloud AI services assessment. We propose a design using a microservice architecture that offers feature contribution explanations for cloud AI services without unfolding the network structure of the cloud models. We can also utilize this architecture to evaluate the model performance and XAI consistency metrics showing cloud AI services trustworthiness. We collect provenance data from operational pipelines to enable reproducibility within the XAI service. Furthermore, we present the discovery scenarios for the experimental tests regarding model performance and XAI consistency metrics for the leading cloud vision AI services. The results confirm that the architecture, based on open APIs, is cloud-agnostic. Additionally, data augmentations result in measurable improvements in XAI consistency metrics for cloud AI services."

We used the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud, where a sample of 11 young bona fide brown dwarfs (spectral type later than M6) were observed simultaneously in X-rays with XMM-Newton and in the U-band with the XMM-Newton Optical/UV Monitor (OM). We obtained upper limits to the U-band emission of 10 brown dwarfs (U>19.6-20.6 mag), whereas 2MASSJ04141188+2811535 was detected in the U-band. Remarkably, the magnitude of this brown dwarf increased regularly from U~19.5 mag at the beginning of the observation, peaked 6h later at U~18.4 mag, and then decreased to U~18.65 mag in the next 2h. The first OM U-band measurement is consistent with the quiescent level observed about one year later thanks to ground follow-up observations. This brown dwarf was not detected in X-rays by XMM-Newton during the OM observation. We discuss the possible sources of U-band variability for this young brown dwarf, namely a magnetic flare, non-steady accretion onto the substellar surface, and rotational modulation of a hot spot. We conclude that this event is related to accretion from a circumsubstellar disk, where the mass accretion rate was about a factor of 3 higher than during the quiescent level."

Haralampos Pozidis","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09437v1","Multi-cloud computing has become increasingly popular with enterprises looking to avoid vendor lock-in. While most cloud providers offer similar functionality, they may differ significantly in terms of performance and/or cost. A customer looking to benefit from such differences will naturally want to solve the multi-cloud configuration problem: given a workload, which cloud provider should be chosen and how should its nodes be configured in order to minimize runtime or cost? In this work, we consider solutions to this optimization problem. We develop and evaluate possible adaptations of state-of-the-art cloud configuration solutions to the multi-cloud domain. Furthermore, we identify an analogy between multi-cloud configuration and the selection-configuration problems commonly studied in the automated machine learning (AutoML) field. Inspired by this connection, we utilize popular optimizers from AutoML to solve multi-cloud configuration. Finally, we propose a new algorithm for solving multi-cloud configuration, CloudBandit (CB). It treats the outer problem of cloud provider selection as a best-arm identification problem, in which each arm pull corresponds to running an arbitrary black-box optimizer on the inner problem of node configuration. Our experiments indicate that (a) many state-of-the-art cloud configuration solutions can be adapted to multi-cloud, with best results obtained for adaptations which utilize the hierarchical structure of the multi-cloud configuration domain, (b) hierarchical methods from AutoML can be used for the multi-cloud configuration task and can outperform state-of-the-art cloud configuration solutions and (c) CB achieves competitive or lower regret relative to other tested algorithms, whilst also identifying configurations that have 65% lower median cost and 20% lower median time in production, compared to choosing a random provider and configuration."

Vrushali Channapattan","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11463v1","While more organizations have been trying to move their infrastructure to the cloud in recent years, there have been significant challenges in how identities and access are managed in a hybrid cloud setting. This paper showcases a novel identity and access management framework for shared resources in a multi-tenant hybrid cloud environment. The paper demonstrates a method to implement the ""mirror"" identities of on-premise identities in the cloud. Following the best security practices, the framework ensures that only rightful users can use their mirror identities in the cloud. Furthermore, the paper also proposes a technique in scaling the framework to accommodate large-scale enterprises. The framework exhibited in the paper provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for enterprises to implement identity and access control in their hybrid cloud infrastructure. Although the paper focuses on implementing the framework in Google Cloud Platform, it can be easily applied to any major public cloud platform."

Holger Karl","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09984v1","Recent studies show the increasing popularity of distributed cloud applications, which are composed of multiple microservices. Besides their known benefits, microservice architecture also enables to mix and match cloud applications and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) services (service chains), which are composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Provisioning complex services containing VNFs and microservices in a combined NFV/cloud platform can enhance service quality and optimise cost. Such a platform can be based on the multi-cloud concept. However, current multi-cloud solutions do not support NFV requirements, making them inadequate to support complex services. In this paper, we investigate these challenges and propose a solution for jointly managing and orchestrating microservices and virtual network functions."

Smart cities, smart manufacturing, augmented reality, and self-driving cars are just some examples of the wide range of domains, where the applicability of such systems has been increasing rapidly. These IoT use cases often require simultaneous access to geographically distributed arrays of sensors, and heterogeneous remote, local as well as multi-cloud computational resources. This gives birth to the extended Cloud-to-Things computing paradigm. The emergence of this new paradigm raised the quintessential need to extend the orchestration requirements i.e., the automated deployment and run-time management) of applications from the centralised cloud-only environment to the entire spectrum of resources in the Cloud-to-Things continuum. In order to cope with this requirement, in the last few years, there has been a lot of attention to the development of orchestration systems in both industry and academic environments. This paper is an attempt to gather the research conducted in the orchestration for the Cloud-to-Things continuum landscape and to propose a detailed taxonomy, which is then used to critically review the landscape of existing research work. We finally discuss the key challenges that require further attention and also present a conceptual framework based on the conducted analysis."

One of the main challenges in Cloud of Things is the resource discovery of the smart objects and their reuse in different contexts. Most of the existent work uses some kind of multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm to perform the resource discovery, but do not evaluate the impact that the user constraints has in the final solution. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of the SAW, TOPSIS and VIKOR multi-objective decision analyses algorithms and the impact of user constraints on them. We evaluated the quality of the proposed solutions using the Pareto-optimality concept."

It supports most data operations because data can be stored in clear as opposed to methods that rely on cryptography. However, majority of existing data splitting techniques do not consider data already in the multi-cloud. This leads to unnecessary use of resources to re-split data into fragments. This work proposes a data splitting framework that leverages on existing data in the multi-cloud. It improves data splitting mechanisms by reducing the number of splitting operations and resulting fragments. Therefore, decreasing the number of storage locations a data owner manages. Broadcasts queries locate third-party data fragments to avoid costly operations when splitting data. This work examines considerations for the use of third-party fragments and application to existing data splitting techniques. The proposed framework was also applied to an existing data splitting mechanism to complement its capabilities."

It allows businesses to cut down heavy cost incurred over IT infrastructure without losing focus on customer needs. However, Cloud industry to an extent has struggled to grow among SMEs due to the reluctance and concerns expressed by them. Throughout the course of this study several interviews were conducted and the literature was reviewed to understand how cloud providers offer services and what challenges SMEs are facing. The study identified issues like cloud knowledge, interoperability, security and contractual concerns to be hindering SMEs adoption of cloud services. From the interviews common practices followed by cloud vendors and what concerns SMEs have were identified as a basis for a cloud framework which will bridge gaps between cloud vendors and SMEs. A stepwise framework for cloud adoption is formulated which identifies and provides recommendation to four most predominant challenges which are hurting cloud industry and taking SMEs away from cloud computing, as well as guide SMEs aiding in successful cloud adoption. Moreover, this framework streamlines the cloud adoption process for SMEs by removing ambiguity in regards to fundamentals associated with their organisation and cloud adoption process."

In this paper, we present a fully dynamic multi- learners approach for automated and online QoS modeling in the cloud. We contribute to a hybrid learners solution, which improves accuracy while keeping model complexity adequate. To determine the inputs of QoS model at runtime, we partition the inputs space into two sub-spaces, each of which applies different symmetric uncertainty based selection techniques, and we then combine the sub-spaces results. The learners are also adaptive; they simultaneously allow several machine learning algorithms to model QoS function and dynamically select the best model for prediction on the fly. We experimentally evaluate our models using RUBiS benchmark and realistic FIFA 98 workload.
