Ali Eslami","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00955v2","Coupling cyber and physical systems gives rise to numerous engineering challenges and opportunities. An important challenge is the contagion of failure from one system to another, that can lead to large scale cascading failures. On the other hand, self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity where the overlay cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical network. To capture both self-healing and contagion, we introduce a factor graph representation of inter-dependent cyber-physical systems in which factor nodes represent various node functionalities and the edges capture the interactions between the nodes. We develop a message passing algorithm to study the dynamics of failure propagation and healing in this representation. Through applying a fixed-point analysis to this algorithm, we investigate the network reaction to initial disruptions. Our analysis provides simple yet critical guidelines for choosing network parameters to achieve resiliency against cascading failures."

Mark G. Kuzyk","10.1063/1.4739295","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0481v2","Here we present a model of self healing in which correlations between chromophores, as mediated by the polymer, are key to the recovery process. Our model determines the size distribution of the correlation volume using a grand canonical ensemble through a free energy advantage parameter. Choosing a healing rate that is proportional to the number of undamaged molecules in a correlated region, and a decay rate proportional to the intensity normalized to the correlation volume, the ensemble average is shown to correctly predict decay and recovery of the population of disperse orange 11-DO11 (1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone) molecules doped in PMMA polymer as a function of time and concentration as measured with amplified spontaneous emission and linear absorption spectroscopy using only three parameters that apply to the full set of data. Our model also predicts the temperature dependence of the process. One set of parameters should be characteristic of a particular polymer and dopant chromophore combination. Thus, use of the model in determining these parameters for various materials systems should provide the data needed to test fundamental models of the underlying mechanism responsible for self healing."

Moreover, an unified zoology of self-healing, structured light is proposed to unveil a deeper understanding of its physical mechanism and provide a bird's eye view on diverse forms of self-healing effects of different kinds of complex structured light. Finally, we outline the open challenges we are facing, potential opportunities and future trends for both fundamental physics and applications."

In previous work we experimentally demonstrated self-healing effects in OAM beams at 28 GHz and postulated a theoretical mechanism to account for them. In this work we further characterize the OAM self-healing mechanism theoretically and confirm those characteristics with systematic and controlled experimental measurements on a 28 GHz outdoor link. Specifically, we find that the OAM self-healing mechanism is an additional self-healing mechanism in structured electromagnetic beams which is directional with respect to the displacement of an obstruction relative to the beam axis. We also confirm our previous findings that the amount of OAM self-healing is proportional to the OAM order, and additionally find that it persists beyond the focusing region into the far field. As such, OAM-assisted self-healing brings an advantage over other so-called non-diffracting beams both in terms of the minimum distance for onset of self-healing and the amount of self-healing obtainable. We relate our findings by extending theoretical models in the literature and develop a unifying electromagnetic analysis to account for self-healing of OAM-bearing non-diffracting beams more rigorously."

Following the dynamics and comparing it to different mass transfer mechanisms, we find that sublimation from and condensation onto the ice surface is the dominant self-healing mechanism. The self-healing kinetics shows a strong temperature dependence, following an Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy of $ΔE = 58.6 \pm 4.6$ kJ/mole, agreeing with the proposed sublimation mechanism, and at odds with surface diffusion or fluid flow or evaporation-condensation from a quasi-liquid layer."
"A Survey on Self-healing Software System","https://scispace.com/paper/http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00455v1","2024","Preprint","","Zahra Yazdanparast","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00455v1","With the increasing complexity of software systems, it becomes very difficult to install, configure, adjust, and maintain them. As systems become more interconnected and diverse, system architects are less able to predict and design the interaction between components, deferring the handling of these issues to runtime. One of the important problems that occur during execution is system failures, which increase the need for self-healing systems. The main purpose of self-healing is to have an automatic system that can heal itself without human intervention. This system has predefined actions and procedures that are suitable for recovering the system from different failure modes. In this study, different self-healing methods are categorized and a summary of them is presented."
"Compact Routing Messages in Self-Healing Trees","https://scispace.com/paper/http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04234v1","2015","Preprint","","Armando Castaneda

Amitabh Trehan","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04234v1","Existing compact routing schemes, e.g., Thorup and Zwick [SPAA 2001] and Chechik [PODC 2013], often have no means to tolerate failures, once the system has been setup and started. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first self-healing compact routing scheme. Besides, our schemes are developed for low memory nodes, i.e., nodes need only $O(\log^2 n)$ memory, and are thus, compact schemes.
  We introduce two algorithms of independent interest: The first is CompactFT, a novel compact version (using only $O(\log n)$ local memory) of the self-healing algorithm Forgiving Tree of Hayes et al. [PODC 2008]. The second algorithm (CompactFTZ) combines CompactFT with Thorup-Zwick's tree-based compact routing scheme [SPAA 2001] to produce a fully compact self-healing routing scheme. In the self-healing model, the adversary deletes nodes one at a time with the affected nodes self-healing locally by adding few edges. CompactFT recovers from each attack in only $O(1)$ time and $Δ$ messages, with only +3 degree increase and $O(log Δ)$ graph diameter increase, over any sequence of deletions ($Δ$ is the initial maximum degree).
  Additionally, CompactFTZ guarantees delivery of a packet sent from sender s as long as the receiver t has not been deleted, with only an additional $O(y \log Δ)$ latency, where $y$ is the number of nodes that have been deleted on the path between $s$ and $t$. If $t$ has been deleted, $s$ gets informed and the packet removed from the network."

Dominik Ascher","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12773v1","Motivation: Smart grids design requires energy distribution operations to be adaptable to abnormality. This requirement entails distribution system operators (DSOs) to optimize restoration to normal operational states dynamically. However, these design challenges demand collaborative research efforts on sophisticated modeling and simulation approaches. Approach: In the ESOSEG research project, analyzing the smart grid domain as a software-intensive system, we employed a dynamic architecture approach, particularly the FOCUS theory, to model and assure the domains' self-healing requirements. Although some works specify various self-healing systems, to the best of our knowledge, the use of the approach in smart grids is the first work to enable a formal specification and verification of self-healing properties in smart grids. Results: As a result, to support the modeling and verification process, we developed tool support with Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), Xtext, and other languages in the EMF ecosystem. The tool includes a grammar or a meta-model of the DSL, an interface to enable textual and graphical modeling of architectural patterns and code transformer engine for verification. Furthermore, we evaluated the modeling and verification features of the tool support with an e-Car charging scenario for modeling adaptive self-healing properties. Futureworks: As an outlook, future works could include investigation of comprehensive case studies. These, for instance, could be further particular adaptability scenarios addressing challenges in DSOs. Another interesting aspect could be the evaluation of the modeling approach by investigating its use with engineers involved in a smart grid design. Next, the evaluation could be followed with abstractions of the verification process to make it useable by system architects with no knowledge of the proof language, Isabelle/HOL."

Zheng Zhang","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12963v1","Despite the wide applications of neural networks, there have been increasing concerns about their vulnerability issue. While numerous attack and defense techniques have been developed, this work investigates the robustness issue from a new angle: can we design a self-healing neural network that can automatically detect and fix the vulnerability issue by itself? A typical self-healing mechanism is the immune system of a human body. This biology-inspired idea has been used in many engineering designs but is rarely investigated in deep learning. This paper considers the post-training self-healing of a neural network, and proposes a closed-loop control formulation to automatically detect and fix the errors caused by various attacks or perturbations. We provide a margin-based analysis to explain how this formulation can improve the robustness of a classifier. To speed up the inference of the proposed self-healing network, we solve the control problem via improving the Pontryagin Maximum Principle-based solver. Lastly, we present an error estimation of the proposed framework for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions. We validate the performance on several network architectures against various perturbations. Since the self-healing method does not need a-priori information about data perturbations/attacks, it can handle a broad class of unforeseen perturbations."

However, Li-dendrite growth is a safety concern and results in low coulombic efficiency, which significantly restricts the commercial application of Li secondary batteries. Unfortunately, the Li deposition (growth) mechanism is poorly understood on the atomic scale. Here, we used machine learning to construct a Li potential model with quantum-mechanical computational accuracy. Molecular dynamics simulations in this study with this model revealed two self-healing mechanisms in a large Li-metal system, viz. surface self-healing and bulk self-healing, and identified three Li-dendrite morphologies under different conditions, viz. ""needle"", ""mushroom"", and ""hemisphere"". Finally, we introduce the concepts of local current density and variance in local current density to supplement the critical current density when evaluating the probability of self-healing."

The goal of this study is to explore a new self-healing approach in which fungi are used as a self-healing agent to promote calcium carbonate precipitation to fill the cracks in concrete structures. Recent research results in the field of geomycology have shown that many species of fungi could play an important role in promoting calcium carbonate mineralization, but their application in self-healing concrete has not been reported. Therefore, a screening of different species of fungi has been conducted in this study. Our results showed that, despite the drastic pH increase owing to the leaching of calcium hydroxide from concrete, Aspergillus nidulans (MAD1445), a pH regulatory mutant, could grow on concrete plates and promote calcium carbonate precipitation."

Sugata Sanyal","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.6285v1","A fundamental concern of any secure group communication system is key management and wireless environments create new challenges. One core requirement in these emerging networks is self-healing. In systems where users can be offline and miss updates, self-healing allows a user to recover lost session keys and get back into the secure communication without putting extra burden on the group manager. Clearly, self-healing must only be available to authorized users. This paper fixes the problem of collusion attack in an existing self-healing key distribution scheme and provides a highly efficient scheme as compared to the existing works. It is computationally secure, resists collusion attacks made between newly joined users and revoked users and achieves forward and backward secrecy. Our security analysis is in an appropriate security model. Unlike the existing constructions, our scheme does not forbid revoked users from rejoining in later sessions."

Our algorithms are the first single-Laplacian methods to exhibit all of these characteristics. We achieve self-healing by sacrificing internal stability, a fundamental trade-off for single-Laplacian methods."

We demonstrate that in this low-damage regime, the changes in the conductance and similar transport/response properties of the material can be used as measures of the material quality degradation."

The proposed tactile sensor consists of a structure that includes a diode, a phototransistor, and an optical waveguide made from self-healing materials. This design offers the advantage of being less susceptible to electromagnetic noise compared to traditional tactile sensors based on electrical detection principles. The sensor estimates the applied force by detecting changes in the total internal reflection caused by deformation due to contact force. In this study, we first established a fabrication method for the optical waveguide-based tactile sensor using self-healing materials. Subsequently, we measured the sensor output when a static load was applied to the fabricated tactile sensor and evaluated its characteristics. The results confirmed that the sensor output decreases in response to the applied load."

Additionally, we briefly discuss the self-healing limit of the beam in an off-axis scenario. Our results indicate that field amplitude of the beam will be healed well when the obstacle is approximately on-axis without oversized radius, perhaps providing advantages for optical communication, imaging, and remote sensing systems."

In the adiabatic regime, such errors are known to exhibit long-time self-healing [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{131}, 060602 (2023)], where discretization effects are effectively suppressed. Here we show that self-healing persists at finite evolution times once nonadiabatic errors induced by finite-speed ramps are compensated. Using counterdiabatic driving to cancel diabatic transitions and isolate discretization effects, we study both noninteracting and interacting spin models and characterize the finite-time scaling with the Trotter steps and the total evolution time. In the instantaneous eigenbasis of the driven Hamiltonian, the leading digital error maps to an effective harmonic perturbation whose dominant Fourier component yields an analytic upper bound on the finite-time Trotter error and reveals the phase-cancellation mechanism underlying self-healing. Our results establish finite-time self-healing as a generic feature of digitized counterdiabatic protocols, clarify its mechanism beyond the long-time adiabatic limit, and provide practical guidance for high-fidelity state preparation on gate-based quantum processors."

If failure scenarios come into existence, the user wants the runtime environment to handle those situations autonomically. This paper presents a new technique of finding self-healing actions by matching a fault scenario to already established fault models. By profiling and capturing runtime parameters and execution pathWays, stable execution models are established and later are used to match with an unstable execution scenario. Experimentation and results are presented that showed that even with additional overheads; this technique can prove beneficial for autonomically healing faults and reliving system administrators from mundane troubleshooting situations."

Andrea Giuntoli","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11787v1","Glassy polymer melts such as the plastics used in pipes, structural materials, and medical devices are ubiquitous in daily life. They accumulate damage over time due to their use, which limits their functionalities and demands periodic replacement. The resulting economic and social burden could be mitigated by the design of self-healing mechanisms that expand the lifespan of materials. However, the characteristic low molecular mobility in glassy polymer melts intrinsically limits the design of self-healing behavior. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that controlled oscillatory deformations enhance the local molecular mobility of glassy polymers without compromising their structural or mechanical stability. We apply this principle to increase the molecular mobility around the surface of a crack, inducing fracture repair and recovering the mechanical properties of the pristine material. Our findings establish a general physical mechanism of self-healing in glasses that may inspire the design and processing of new glassy materials."
