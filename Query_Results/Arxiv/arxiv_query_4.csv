To our knowledge, workflow systems employ scheduling algorithms that optimize task execution order of workflow to improve performance and execution efficiency. However, due to its inherent scheduling mechanism, Kubernetes does not execute containerized scheduling following the optimized task execution order of workflow amid migrating workflow systems to the Kubernetes platform. This inconsistency in task scheduling order seriously degrades the efficiency of workflow execution and brings numerous challenges to the containerized process of workflow systems on Kubernetes. In this paper, we propose a cloud-native workflow engine, also known as KubeAdaptor, a docking framework able to implement workflow containerization on Kubernetes, integrate workflow systems with Kubernetes, ensuring the consistency of task scheduling order. We introduce the design and architecture of the KubeAdaptor, elaborate on the functionality implementation and the event-trigger mechanism within the KubeAdaptor. Experimental results about four real-world workflows show that the KubeAdaptor ensures the consistency of the workflow systems and Kubernetes in the task scheduling order. Compared with the baseline Argo workflow engine, the KubeAdaptor achieves better performance in terms of the average execution time of task pod, average workflow lifecycle, and resource usage rate."

Organizations, such as IBM, Capital One and Adidas use Kubernetes to deploy and manage their containers, and have reported benefits related to deployment frequency. Despite reported benefits, Kubernetes deployments are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, such as those that occurred at Tesla in 2018. A systematization of Kubernetes security practices can help practitioners mitigate vulnerabilities in their Kubernetes deployments. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners in securing their Kubernetes installations through a systematization of knowledge related to Kubernetes security practices. We systematize knowledge by applying qualitative analysis on 104 Internet artifacts. We identify 11 security practices that include (i) implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) authorization to provide least privilege, (ii) applying security patches to keep Kubernetes updated, and (iii) implementing pod and network specific security policies."

Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for Information Technology (IT) automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Ansible Lightspeed is an LLM-based service designed explicitly to generate Ansible YAML, given natural language prompt.
  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service. We then evaluate its utility to developers using diverse indicators, including extended utilization, analysis of user edited suggestions, as well as user sentiments analysis. The evaluation is based on data collected for 10,696 real users including 3,910 returning users. The code for Ansible Lightspeed service and the analysis framework is made available for others to use.
  To our knowledge, our study is the first to involve thousands of users of code assistants for domain-specific languages. We are also the first code completion tool to present N-Day user retention figures, which is 13.66% on Day 30. We propose an improved version of user acceptance rate, called Strong Acceptance rate, where a suggestion is considered accepted only if less than 50% of it is edited and these edits do not change critical parts of the suggestion. By focusing on Ansible, Lightspeed is able to achieve a strong acceptance rate of 49.08% for multi-line Ansible task suggestions. With our findings we provide insights into the effectiveness of small, dedicated models in a domain-specific context."

Remote sensing observations can, however, provide important information for events close to the Sun. In this work we estimate the flux rope orientation first in the close vicinity of the Sun (2-20 Rs) using forward modeling of STEREO/SECCHI and SOHO/LASCO coronagraph images of coronal mass ejections and then in-situ using Grad-Shafranov reconstruction of the magnetic cloud. Thus, we are able to measure changes in the orientation of the erupted flux ropes as they propagate from the Sun to 1 AU. We present both techniques and use them to study 15 magnetic clouds observed during the minimum following Solar Cycle 23 and the rise of Solar Cycle 24. This is the first multievent study to compare the three-dimensional parameters of CMEs from imaging and in-situ reconstructions. The results of our analysis confirm earlier studies showing that the flux ropes tend to deflect towards the solar equatorial plane. We also find evidence of rotation on their travel from the Sun to 1 AU. In contrast to past studies, our method allows one to deduce the evolution of the three-dimensional orientation of individual flux ropes rather than on a statistical basis."

Laurie Williams","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07159v2","Context: Security smells are recurring coding patterns that are indicative of security weakness, and require further inspection. As infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts, such as Ansible and Chef scripts, are used to provision cloud-based servers and systems at scale, security smells in IaC scripts could be used to enable malicious users to exploit vulnerabilities in the provisioned systems. Goal: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners avoid insecure coding practices while developing infrastructure as code scripts through an empirical study of security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts. Methodology: We conduct a replication study where we apply qualitative analysis with 1,956 IaC scripts to identify security smells for IaC scripts written in two languages: Ansible and Chef. We construct a static analysis tool called Security Linter for Ansible and Chef scripts (SLAC) to automatically identify security smells in 50,323 scripts collected from 813 open source software repositories. We also submit bug reports for 1,000 randomly-selected smell occurrences. Results: We identify two security smells not reported in prior work: missing default in case statement and no integrity check. By applying SLAC we identify 46,600 occurrences of security smells that include 7,849 hard-coded passwords. We observe agreement for 65 of the responded 94 bug reports, which suggests the relevance of security smells for Ansible and Chef scripts amongst practitioners. Conclusion: We observe security smells to be prevalent in Ansible and Chef scripts, similar to that of the Puppet scripts. We recommend practitioners to rigorously inspect the presence of the identified security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts using (i) code review, and (ii) static analysis tools."

Despite its widespread adoption, the performance and scalability of GitOps tools in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) scenarios are insufficiently evaluated. This paper presents a reproducible, metric-driven benchmarking, assessing the latency and resource overheads of three widely used GitOps operators: Argo CD, Flux CD, and ConfigSync. We conduct controlled experiments under both single- and multi-intent scenarios, capturing key performance indicators such as latency and resource consumption. Our results highlight trade-offs between the tools in terms of determinism, resource efficiency, and responsiveness. We further investigate a realistic orchestration scenario, using Nephio as our orchestrator, to quantify the processing latency and overhead in declarative end-to-end deployment pipelines. Our findings can offer valuable insights for tool selection and optimisation in future autonomous network orchestration systems."

Unfortunately, the shell does not scale well to large systems, and configuration management tools like Ansible are more difficult to learn. We address this problem with Dozer, a technique to help developers push their shell commands into Ansible task definitions. It operates by tracing and comparing system calls to find Ansible modules with similar behaviors to shell commands, then generating and validating migrations to find the task which produces the most similar changes to the system. Dozer is syntax agnostic, which should allow it to generalize to other configuration management platforms. We evaluate Dozer using datasets from open source configuration scripts."

In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels.
  Based on our findings, we highlight key directions for improving Ansible, with implications for other IaC technologies, including stronger failure locality to support debugging, clearer separation of language and templating boundaries, targeted documentation, and improved execution backends to address performance issues. By grounding these insights in the real-world struggles of Ansible users, this study provides actionable guidance for tool designers and for the broader IaC community, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools."

Kubernetes largely targets the cloud environment but new use cases require performant, available and scalable orchestration at the edge. Kubernetes stores all cluster state in etcd, a strongly consistent key-value store. We find that at larger etcd cluster sizes, offering higher availability, write request latency significantly increases and throughput decreases similarly. Coupled with approximately 30% of Kubernetes requests being writes, this directly impacts the request latency and availability of Kubernetes, reducing its suitability for the edge. We revisit the requirement of strong consistency and propose an eventually consistent approach instead. This enables higher performance, availability and scalability whilst still supporting the broad needs of Kubernetes. This aims to make Kubernetes much more suitable for performance-critical, dynamically-scaled edge solutions."

For this purpose, experiments are conducted to examine the performance of two virtualization modes, namely HVM and PV, supported by Xen as the underlying hypervisor. Moreover, two container runtimes that are integrated with Kubernetes, namely Docker, and Containerd, are examined to assess their performance on both disk-intensive and CPU-intensive workloads. After determining the appropriate underlying Xen mode and container runtime, the Kubernetes distributions are set up and their performance is measured using various metrics, such as request rate, CPU utilization, and scaling behavior."

Configuration defects are not uncommon and can result in serious consequences. This paper reports an empirical study about configuration defects in Kubernetes with the goal of helping practitioners detect and prevent these defects. We study 719 defects that we extract from 2,260 Kubernetes configuration scripts using open source repositories. Using qualitative analysis, we identify 15 categories of defects. We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect. Our linter revealed 26 previously-unknown defects that have been confirmed by practitioners, 19 of which have already been fixed. We conclude our paper by providing recommendations on how defect detection and repair techniques can be used for Kubernetes configuration scripts. The datasets and source code used for the paper are publicly available online."

In this architectural style, small and loosely coupled modules are developed, deployed, and scaled independently to compose cloud-native applications. However, for carrier-grade service providers to migrate to the microservices architectural style, availability remains a concern. Kubernetes is an open source platform that defines a set of building blocks which collectively provide mechanisms for deploying, maintaining, scaling, and healing containerized microservices. Thus, Kubernetes hides the complexity of microservice orchestration while managing their availability. In a preliminary work we evaluated Kubernetes, using its default configuration, from the availability perspective in a private cloud settings. In this paper, we investigate more architectures and conduct more experiments to evaluate the availability that Kubernetes delivers for its managed microservices. We present different architectures for public and private clouds. We evaluate the availability achievable through the healing capability of Kubernetes. We investigate the impact of adding redundancy on the availability of microservice based applications. We conduct experiments under the default configuration of Kubernetes as well as under its most responsive one. We also perform a comparative evaluation with the Availability Management Framework (AMF), which is a proven solution as a middleware service for managing high-availability. The results of our investigations show that in certain cases, the service outage for applications managed with Kubernetes is significantly high."

Our solution effectively performs load balancing of requests to the worker nodes of a cluster based on the number of running replicas. In P4Kube, the data packets completely bypass the system's control plane. Unlike the previous work, to update its state, the P4Kube data plane works directly with the Kubernetes control plane without any involvement of the network control plane.

For the intrinsic atmospheric ν_τ flux, we extend the validity of a previous calculation from E < 10^6 GeV up to E < 10^11 GeV. The oscillated atmospheric ν_τ flux is, on the other hand, rather suppressed. We find that, for 10^3 < E/GeV < 5\cdot 10^7, the oscillated ν_τ flux along the galactic plane dominates over the maximal intrinsic atmospheric ν_τ flux, i.e., the flux along the horizontal direction.
