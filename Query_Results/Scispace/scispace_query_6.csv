"Policy as Code: A paradigm shifts in infrastructure security and governance","https://scispace.com/paper/policy-as-code-a-paradigm-shifts-in-infrastructure-security-kvokzawwc4y6","2025","Journal Article","World Journal Of Advanced Research and Reviews","Sundeep Vijayaraghavan","10.30574/wjarr.2025.26.1.1441","","Policy as Code represents a transformative approach to infrastructure security and governance in modern cloud environments. By codifying security and compliance policies as machine-readable code, organizations can automate enforcement throughout the development lifecycle. This paradigm shift addresses the velocity gap between rapid development cycles and traditionally slower security processes, enabling consistent policy enforcement without sacrificing agility. The integration with CI/CD pipelines allows for ""shifting left"" security considerations, identifying and remediating issues before they reach production. Various implementation approaches have emerged, from open-source tools like Open Policy Agent to cloud-native solutions, each with distinct advantages. While implementation challenges exist, including policy language complexity and organizational alignment, established best practices help organizations navigate these hurdles. As infrastructure continues to evolve, Policy as Code emerges as an essential strategy for maintaining security and compliance in dynamic, cloud-native environments, transforming governance from a perceived roadblock into an enabler of innovation. ","""Policy as Code"" paradigm shifts infrastructure security and governance by automating policy enforcement through machine-readable code, bridging the velocity gap between development and security, and enabling consistent policy enforcement without sacrificing agility in cloud-native environments."

Rather than relying on manual, after-the-fact evidence collection, the chapter advocates integrating compliance directly into development and deployment workflows. Approaches such as Infrastructure as Code and Policy-as-Code are emphasized, alongside automated enforcement mechanisms, immutable audit trails, and robust observability to support ongoing regulatory adherence. However, technology alone is not sufficient—success also hinges on fostering cross-functional collaboration, upskilling teams, and driving cultural change so that compliance becomes an intrinsic part of day-to-day operations. By aligning governance with the agility demanded by contemporary software delivery, this framework supports audit readiness, mitigates risk, and helps organizations maintain trust with stakeholders.

"DevSecOps-Driven Security Framework for CI/CD Pipeline Risk Mitigation","https://scispace.com/paper/devsecops-driven-security-framework-for-ci-cd-pipeline-risk-yjape1hq893s","2025","Journal Article","International journal of computing and engineering","Arpit Mishra","10.47941/ijce.3047","","Modern software development organizations face escalating security challenges within their Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline infrastructure, necessitating robust DevSecOps methodologies to counter sophisticated vulnerabilities. Contemporary DevSecOps frameworks establish security controls at every stage of the pipeline lifecycle, systematically addressing threats that pose risks to software delivery operations and organizational assets. By implementing structured security integration strategies, organizations achieve both velocity and protection without sacrificing either priority. The zero-trust frameworks analyzed within this context demonstrate significant efficacy when applied to pipeline components, establishing verification checkpoints at critical junctures. Policy-as-code solutions further automate compliance verification, ensuring that security requirements remain enforceable across evolving infrastructure configurations. Security benchmarking results demonstrate substantial improvements in vulnerability detection timeliness, threat containment capabilities, and overall defensive posture when the prescribed controls operate cohesively. The framework establishes governance structures, validation mechanisms, and monitoring protocols that function effectively within rapid deployment cycles while maintaining appropriate security guardrails. Through systematic implementation of these integrated security practices, development teams and security professionals collaborate effectively to create resilient CI/CD environments capable of withstanding evolving threats while preserving deployment velocity. ","This study proposes a DevSecOps-driven security framework for CI/CD pipeline risk mitigation, integrating security controls at every stage to address threats, achieve velocity and protection, and automate compliance verification, resulting in improved vulnerability detection and defensive posture."

However, it's extremely challenging to orchestrate the underlying infrastructure for such a distributed system, such as complexity, consistency, and governance at scale. To address these, automation through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a front-runner, allowing for declarative provisioning of infrastructure, while Policy as Code (PaC) enforces security, compliance, and operational policy governance through codified policies. This study tries to provide a holistic model that combines IaC and PaC to automate infrastructure provisioning and policy enforcement in a consistent way throughout the deployment pipeline. Through the use of solutions like Terraform for infrastructure and Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce policy, the model is proposed to enhance the speed of deployment, reduce human error, and achieve policy compliance.","This study proposes a unified framework combining Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Policy as Code (PaC) to automate infrastructure provisioning and policy enforcement in cloud-native environments, enhancing deployment speed, reducing errors, and ensuring policy compliance."
"Advancing Organizational Resilience Through Enterprise GRC Integration Frameworks","https://scispace.com/paper/advancing-organizational-resilience-through-enterprise-grc-43i377lbd15r","2024","Journal Article","","Nnennaya Halliday","10.62225/2583049x.2024.4.5.4888","","In an era defined by regulatory complexity, escalating cyber threats, and rapid market volatility, organizational resilience has emerged as a critical determinant of long-term competitiveness. Traditional siloed approaches to governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) are increasingly inadequate for navigating these challenges, as they hinder cross-functional collaboration and real-time decision-making. This examines the role of Enterprise GRC Integration Frameworks as a strategic enabler for resilience, focusing on the unification of governance, risk, and compliance processes into a cohesive, enterprise-wide architecture. By aligning policy, process, and technology layers, integrated GRC frameworks facilitate proactive risk identification, standardized compliance monitoring, and agile incident response capabilities. This explores core framework components—governance oversight, enterprise risk registers, unified compliance reporting, and data governance—underpinned by interoperable technology platforms and automation. Methodologies such as process mapping, workflow standardization, and Policy-as-Code implementation are discussed as pathways to embedding compliance and risk management into operational systems. Moreover, integrated GRC enables predictive analytics, scenario modeling, and adaptive feedback loops, thereby enhancing the organization’s ability to anticipate disruptions and adapt policies in real time. Implementation challenges, including cultural resistance, technology fragmentation, and change management complexities, are analyzed alongside mitigation strategies emphasizing executive sponsorship, phased deployment, interoperable platforms, and continuous GRC literacy programs. Future directions highlight the integration of artificial intelligence for policy interpretation and anomaly detection, as well as the alignment of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics with resilience objectives. Ultimately, Enterprise GRC Integration Frameworks are positioned not merely as compliance mechanisms but as strategic infrastructures that build stakeholder confidence, safeguard operational continuity, and drive sustainable performance. Organizations that embrace integrated GRC as a resilience enabler will be better equipped to navigate uncertainty, meet evolving regulatory demands, and maintain trust in an increasingly volatile global environment.","This study examines the role of Enterprise GRC Integration Frameworks in enhancing organizational resilience through unified governance, risk, and compliance processes, leveraging interoperable technology platforms, predictive analytics, and adaptive feedback loops to navigate regulatory complexity and uncertainty."

However, not only are traditional manual compliance processes error-prone, but they are also unlikely to keep pace with the rapidity and scale of cloud-native development. As a response, the paradigm of Compliance-as-Code (CaC) has emerged, integrating compliance requirements into DevOps workflows through code-based, automated, and version-controlled processes. DevOps Compliance-as-Code is the topic of this article, which covers the theoretical background and technologies that make this approach possible, real-life applications, and the emerging research trends. Drawing from scholarly and industry literature, including recent advances in secure DevOps, cloud automation, and generative AI, the discussion demonstrates how Compliance-as-Code ensures traceability, repeatability, and auditability of compliance actions across the software lifecycle (Vadisetty et al., 2023; Abrahams &amp; Langerman, 2018). With policies embedded as runnable code, organizations may achieve proactive control of risks, regulatory controls, and efficient governance in highly dynamic and decentralized development platforms.

However, the dynamic and distributed nature of lakehouses introduces significant governance challenges, particularly in ensuring continuous compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks. This paper proposes a novel DevSecOps Policy-as-Code (PaC) model tailored for lakehouse environments that automates compliance enforcement across data ingestion, transformation, storage, and consumption layers. By integrating declarative policy definitions into CI/CD pipelines, the model enables real-time policy validation and enforcement through a centralized policy registry and a powerful policy engine. It supports multiple enforcement stages, pre-deployment checks, runtime validations, and periodic audits, while generating comprehensive, automated audit logs to ensure traceability and accountability. The architecture facilitates seamless integration with leading lakehouse platforms such as Databricks, Delta Lake, and Apache Iceberg, and automates security controls including role-based and attribute-based access management, secrets handling, and encryption enforcement. Observability features provide continuous monitoring of compliance posture, alerting mechanisms, and remediation workflows, transforming compliance from a static checkpoint to a dynamic, continuous process. This approach reduces manual overhead, mitigates risk, and fosters a compliance-first culture within agile data teams. The paper concludes by discussing practical implications for enterprise data governance and outlining future research directions, including semantic policy modeling, AI-enhanced compliance analytics, and multi-cloud policy harmonization. The proposed model represents a significant step toward scalable, auditable, and adaptive compliance automation in next-generation lakehouse data architectures.

In addition to this, the specifications also capture policy / procedure / contractual / regulatory / legislation / standard compliances with respect to a given client industry. The SDLC must adhere to service level agreements (SLAs) while being compliant to development activities, processes, tools, frameworks, and reuse of open-source software components. In today's world, global software development happens across geographically distributed (autonomous) teams consuming extraordinary amounts of open source components drawn from a variety of disparate sources. Although this is helping organizations deal with technical and economic challenges, it is also increasing unintended risks, e.g., use of a non-complaint license software might lead to copyright issues and litigations, use of a library with vulnerabilities pose security risks etc. Mitigation of such risks and remedial measures is a challenge due to lack of visibility and transparency of activities across these distributed teams as they mostly operate in silos. We believe a unified model that non-invasively monitors and analyzes the activities of distributed teams will help a long way in building software that adhere to various compliances.

We show how subsets of the regulations, industry guidances or best practices that are expressed in terms of the metamodel can be (semi-)automatically transformed into event monitoring rules with the help of temporal rule patterns.

The article explores the theoretical framework of Sac, including its foundations in immutability, shift-left principles, and automated feedback mechanisms. Implementation strategies within Jenkins pipelines highlight practical approaches to security scanning integration, policy as code, secrets management, and compliance automation. The organizational impact of Sac implementation extends beyond technical improvements to catalyze cultural transformation, breaking down traditional silos between development, operations, and security teams. Despite compelling benefits, challenges persist in tool integration, skills availability, governance requirements, and cultural resistance.

This new computing paradigm offers numerous advantages but also, poses significant challenges. Advantages are related to the flexibility service providers have on deploying virtual resources on as-needed-basis, providing thus opportunities for large scale computing capabilities, while limiting the total cost of ownership. However, these benefits come at the cost of the user partially losing control over the deployed resources and the cost managing platforms and applications that are now provisioned at an unprecedented rate and interaction complexity.

This research explores the convergence of security policy enforcement with behavioral threat detection within CI/CD pipelines, focusing on practices and tools. We discuss the limitations of legacy DevOps security approaches, including late-stage vulnerability identification and insufficient runtime protection, and highlight the rising need for behavior-based detection to counter advanced threats and insider breaches. Materials and Methods: While static analysis and Infrastructure-as-Code scanning are useful strategies for evaluating security policies, a more comprehensive approach examines both compliance-focused tools and behavioral monitoring techniques. Findings: Compliance as-code frameworks define policies that are automatically checked, yet anomaly detection within system calls, container events, and source code changes offers a dynamic perspective on threats. Previously, integration of these checks into CI/CD platforms like Jenkins and GitLab relied on manual security reviews of alerts and build checkpoints to demonstrate how security checkpoints and alerts were managed before the adoption of AI-driven automation. Through case studies such as the Solar Winds breach and practical pipeline examples, we illustrate how combined policy and behavior-based controls can enhance threat prevention. However, we also identify the significant challenges to solutions, including high false positive rates and limited cross-layer correlation capabilities.

Quality degradation typically happens due to changes in policies, regulations, and industry requirements, which, in turn, complicates compliance management over time. Among the key challenges in managing the evolution of software are the modelling and the enforcement of compliance rules. Moreover, the gap between compliance experts and software engineers has worsened the problem. The topology and orchestration specifications for cloud applications (TOSCA), which is an OASIS standard, has the potential to offer a relief by enabling different levels of abstractions for modeling and enforcing compliance policies. This work aims at investigating the potential of using TOSCA service templates for modelling and enforcing non-functional requirements and policies. Then, it proposes an approach that maximizes involvement of stakeholders in modeling and auditing such requirements and policies. Findings can help enterprises and policy makers achieve better governance and compliance on software services.","This study investigates TOSCA's potential for modeling and enforcing compliance policies in software systems, proposing an approach to maximize stakeholder involvement and improve governance and compliance in software services through non-functional requirements and policy modeling."

In addition, the difference of perception and expertise of multiple stakeholders involving in system and compliance engineering further complicates the analyzing, implementing, and assessing of compliance. For these reasons, in many cases, business compliance today is reached on aper-case basis by using ad hoc, hand-crafted solutions for specific rules to which they must comply.

This review proposes a comprehensive governance framework model that integrates the roles of artificial intelligence (AI), security, compliance, and management to enhance the effectiveness of cloud operations. AI plays a critical role in optimizing resource allocation and improving decision-making processes within cloud governance. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, organizations can achieve dynamic resource management, predictive analytics, and automated compliance monitoring, which enhance operational efficiency and reduce human error. Furthermore, the integration of AI in security management facilitates real-time threat detection and response, allowing organizations to proactively mitigate risks associated with data breaches and cyberattacks. Security is a paramount concern in cloud governance, given the shared responsibility model between cloud providers and clients. This framework emphasizes the implementation of comprehensive security measures, including data encryption, identity management, and incident response protocols, to safeguard sensitive information and maintain customer trust. Compliance with regulatory requirements is essential in ensuring organizational accountability and minimizing legal risks. The proposed governance model incorporates automated compliance checks and reporting mechanisms, ensuring adherence to industry-specific regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Moreover, effective management of cloud resources is crucial for optimizing performance and controlling costs. The governance framework outlines best practices for lifecycle management, cost optimization, and resource allocation, enabling organizations to achieve their strategic objectives. This governance framework model underscores the importance of integrating AI, security, compliance, and management for a holistic approach to cloud governance, providing organizations with the necessary tools to navigate the complexities of cloud computing while maximizing its benefits.

Unfortunately, this goal is hardly achievable due to the divergence and frequent changes of compliance sources and the differences in perception and expertise of the involved stakeholders. In the long run, these issues lead to problems regarding complexity, understandability, maintainability, and reusability of compliance concerns. Objective: In this article, we present a model-driven and view-based approach for addressing problems related to compliance concerns. Method: Compliance concerns are represented using separate view models. This is achieved using domain-specific languages (DSLs) that enable non-technical and technical experts to formulate only the excerpts of the system according to their expertise and domain knowledge. The compliance implementations, reports, and documentation can be automatically generated from the models. The applicability of our approach has been validated using an industrial case study. Results: Our approach supports stakeholders in dealing with the divergence of multiple compliance sources. The compliance controls and relevant reports and documentation are generated from the models and hence become traceable, understandable, and reusable. Because the generated artifacts are associated with the models, the compliance information won't be lost as the system evolves. DSLs and view models convey compliance concerns to each stakeholder in a view that is most appropriate for his/her current work task. Conclusions: Our approach lays a solid foundation for ensuring conformance to relevant laws and regulations. This approach, on the one hand, aims at addressing the variety of expertise and domain knowledge of stakeholders.

Government agencies, sector regulators, and independent auditors systematically examine cloud infrastructure arrangements, requiring thorough documentation of security measures and administrative procedures. This expanding oversight demands structured compliance methodologies incorporating distinct control categories throughout resource lifecycles. Preventive systems establish configuration parameters before deployment, detective mechanisms continually assess environment conditions against defined standards, while corrective processes automatically address identified discrepancies. Establishing this multifaceted framework presents coordination challenges across existing technical processes, necessitating alignment between development activities, operational functions, and governance structures. Organizations must resolve potential capability gaps between native platform services, establish appropriate automation boundaries, and maintain consistent classification schemes across control types. Automation possibilities extend throughout compliance processes, from standard definition through enforcement and into evidence compilation for verification purposes. Forward-looking compliance structures provide considerable operational benefits beyond regulatory fulfillment, including faster deployment through pre-validated designs, fewer security events through uniform control implementation, efficient audit preparation through ongoing evidence gathering, and enhanced risk awareness through unified compliance visibility. These practical advantages transform compliance activities from obligatory requirements into strategic assets through improved governance maturity and operational discipline.

"Policy-driven governance in cloud service ecosystems","https://scispace.com/paper/policy-driven-governance-in-cloud-service-ecosystems-5fcs2gkvvu","2016","Dissertation","","Dimitrios Kourtesis","","","Cloud application development platforms facilitate new models of software co-development and forge environments best characterised as cloud service ecosystems. The value of those ecosystems increases exponentially with the addition of more users and third-party services. Growth however breeds complexity and puts reliability at risk, requiring all stakeholders to exercise control over changes in the ecosystem that may affect them. This is a challenge of governance. From the viewpoint of the ecosystem coordinator, governance is about preventing negative ripple effects from new software added to the platform. From the viewpoint of third-party developers and end-users, governance is about ensuring that the cloud services they consume or deliver comply with requirements on a continuous basis.

To facilitate different forms of governance in a cloud service ecosystem we need governance support systems that achieve separation of concerns between the roles of policy provider, governed resource provider and policy evaluator. This calls for better modularisation of the governance support system architecture, decoupling governance policies from policy evaluation engines and governed resources. It also calls for an improved approach to policy engineering with increased automation and efficient exchange of governance policies and related data between ecosystem partners.
The thesis supported by this research is that governance support systems that satisfy such requirements are both feasible and useful to develop through a framework that integrates Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles.

The PROBE framework presented in this dissertation comprises four components: (1) a governance ontology serving as shared ecosystem vocabulary for policies and resources; (2) a method for the definition of governance policies; (3) a method for sharing descriptions of governed resources between ecosystem partners; (4) a method for evaluating governance policies against descriptions of governed ecosystem resources. The feasibility and usefulness of PROBE are demonstrated with the help of an industrial case study on cloud service ecosystem governance.","The thesis supported by this research is that governance support systems that satisfy different forms of governance in a cloud service ecosystem are both feasible and useful to develop through a framework that integrates Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles."

As organizations expand their digital footprint through cloud integration, IoT adoption, and hybrid work models, the traditional manual approach to network configuration has become increasingly unsustainable. The heterogeneous nature of contemporary networks, typically encompassing multiple vendors, platforms, and technologies, creates significant challenges for maintaining configuration consistency, ensuring regulatory compliance, and safeguarding security postures. This article explores the fundamental components of effective configuration and compliance automation frameworks, including centralized policy repositories, configuration management tools, continuous monitoring systems, and automated remediation workflows. It presents implementation strategies based on organizational maturity and network complexity, outlining critical success factors and addressing common challenges such as legacy device integration and change management resistance. The substantial benefits of automation across operational efficiency, security enhancement, compliance management, and financial performance demonstrate why configuration and compliance automation has become essential for organizations seeking to maintain competitive advantage in an increasingly digital business landscape. As automation technologies continue to evolve, incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, the potential for self-healing, adaptive networks points toward a future where network operations can focus on innovation rather than maintenance.

This paper proposes a conceptual model for a secure DevOps architecture that leverages Jenkins, Terraform, and Kubernetes to ensure continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code (IaC), and container orchestration, all underpinned by robust security principles. Jenkins facilitates automated building, testing, and deployment pipelines, while Terraform enables secure infrastructure provisioning through immutable, version-controlled configurations. Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications, providing dynamic scaling, automated failover, and efficient resource utilization. Together, these tools offer a powerful synergy that can automate development workflows while embedding security measures throughout the software delivery process. The proposed model introduces a security-first approach across the development lifecycle, encompassing code validation, vulnerability scanning, secrets management, policy enforcement, and runtime security. Jenkins pipelines integrate security scanners at multiple stages to detect vulnerabilities early. Terraform configurations are audited for compliance using tools such as Checkov and Terraform Compliance, ensuring secure infrastructure deployment. Kubernetes clusters are fortified with role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, admission controllers, and runtime threat detection solutions like Falco. This conceptual model emphasizes automation, scalability, and proactive threat mitigation, minimizing human error and enabling organizations to achieve secure, rapid software delivery. Additionally, it addresses challenges such as secrets management, with integrations like Vault and Sealed Secrets, and policy enforcement through tools like OPA-Gatekeeper. The model also recommends continuous monitoring and feedback loops to detect anomalies and enforce corrective actions in near real-time. By adopting this secure DevOps architecture, organizations can bridge the gap between agility and security, meeting modern demands for rapid innovation without compromising system integrity. This work contributes to the growing body of DevSecOps knowledge by providing a comprehensive framework that operationalizes security from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment. Future extensions of the model could explore the integration of AI-driven security analytics and self-healing capabilities to further enhance resilience.

Additionally, the deployment of cloud applications is commonly subject to compliance rules. Moreover, designing compliant IaC-based cloud deployments is not enough since runtime changes to the infrastructure or the configuration of individual components may introduce compliance violations. Often, the process of checking and fixing such violations is done manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, this work aims to define and implement a method for runtime IaC compliance management that reduces the complexity, effort, and uncertainty of checking and enforcing compliance rules against IaC-based cloud deployments at runtime. To this end, we follow the design-science research methodology to design and implement (i) the Runtime IaC Compliance Management (RICMa) method and (ii) the IaC Compliance Management Framework (IaCMF) that supports the execution of the RICMa method. We prototypically implement IaCMF and evaluate it using a qualitative interview study with industry experts.","The complexity and uncertainty of checking and enforcing compliance rules against IaC-based cloud deployments at runtime are significant challenges.

Several Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques, such as reliability testing, and modeling and simulation, can be used for assessing that such systems meet their legal. Typically, one has to model the expected (legal) behavior of the system in a form that can be executed (simulated), subject the resulting models and the system to the same input data, and then compare the observed behavior of the model simulation and system execution. 
Existing V&V techniques often rely on code and complex logical expressions with no intuitive appeal to legal experts for specifying the expected behavior of a given system. Subsequently, one has no practical way to validate with legal experts that the underlying legal requirements are indeed complete and constitute a faithful representation of what needs to be implemented. Further, manually defining the expected behavior of a system and its test oracles is a tedious and error-prone task. The challenge here is to find a suitable knowledge representation that can be understood by all the involved stakeholders, e.g., software engineers and legal experts, but that remains complete and precise enough to enable automated analysis such as simulation and testing. 
As real data is seldom accessible in highly regulated domains, V&V requires the generation of synthetic testing data that can be used to build confidence in the reliability of the system under test. In particular, such data has to be structurally and logically well-formed to raise meaningful failures that can help reasoning about the reliability of the system under test. Further, the data should exhibit as much as possible the actual or anticipated system usage to help mimic how the system would behave under realistic circumstances. Generating such data is not a trivial task as the underlying data schemas are usually large and subject to numerous complex domain-related logical constraints. 
In this thesis, we investigate the use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and model-driven technologies, e.g., model to code transformations, to facilitate V&V activities for information systems that have to conform to laws and regulations, while tackling the above challenges.

To accomplish these goals, it is necessary to ensure that the architecture and its evolution are compliant with business goals, best practices, legal and regulatory requirements. However, compliance verification of SOA is difficult due to the wide set of domains and the heterogeneity of the elements used to compose a service oriented solution. Although ontologies and rules could provide a solution for this problem, this approach cannot represent and verify a significant set of governance policies. Therefore, we propose intelliGOV, an architecture that gathers data from SOA environment, loads it in an ontology and uses semantic rules and queries to verify compliance. A case study conducted in a global energy company provides evidence of solution expressiveness, low coding demand and independence of methods and tools.","In this paper, the authors propose intelliGOV, an architecture that gathers data from SOA environment, loads it in an ontology and uses semantic rules and queries to verify compliance."

Recent paradigms, such as cloud computing, also require software to operate in heterogeneous, highly distributed, and changing environments. In these environments, compliance requirements can vary at runtime and traditional compliance management techniques, which are normally applied at design time, may no longer be sufficient. In this paper, we motivate the need for adaptive compliance by illustrating possible compliance concerns determined by runtime variability. We further motivate our work by means of a cloud computing scenario, and present two main contributions. First, we propose and justify a process to support adaptive compliance that ex- tends the traditional compliance management lifecycle with the activities of the Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute (MAPE) loop, and enacts adaptation through re-configuration. Second, we explore the literature on software compliance and classify existing work in terms of the activities and concerns of adaptive compliance.

By now, governance and Non Functional Properties (such as security, QoS…) are managed in a static way, limiting the global benefits of deploying service-based information system over multi-cloud environments. To overcome this limit, we propose a contextualised policy generation process to allow both an agile management NFP in a multi-cloud context and a secured deployment of the service-based information system. The last step of this Model Driven Policy Engineering approach uses policies as Model@runtime to select, compose, deploy and orchestrate NFP management functions depending on the exact execution context. Moreover, a dynamic governance loop including autonomic KPI management is used to control continuously the governance results.","A contextualised policy generation process is proposed to allow both an agile management NFP in a multi-cloud context and a secured deployment of the service-based information system."

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an important DevOps technique that involves defining and managing infrastructure requirements using code, enabling for automated provisioning and maintenance. This technique enhances traceability, reuse, and consistency across development and production environments. The introduction of microservices architectures has increased project teams’ infras- tructure responsibilities, making IaC essential for delivering reliable and efficient deployments. IaC enables developers to describe infrastructure in code, simplifying the deployment process. In both large and small businesses, IaC is essen- tial for supporting efficient DevOps processes.The most recent breakthroughs, tools, and techniques in IaC demonstrate a revolutionary impact on software development and deployment workflows. As more businesses adopt cloud-native designs and containerisation technologies, the requirement for automated infrastructure provisioning grows, leading in the growth of IaC tools and methodologies. Organisations that combine IaC with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines can re- duce time-to-market and improve operational efficiency. IaC not only automates infrastructure management, but it also includes software engineering principles like version control and testing into infrastructure provisioning, which improves consistency and reliability. This democratisation of infrastructure management encourages increased collaboration across cross-functional teams, hence improving accountability and innovation. Implementing IaC is therefore crucial for achieving agility, scalability, and resilience in the digital age.

Agbariah","10.1109/SNCC.2014.6866525","","As networks continue to grow exponentially, the need to build, maintain, and troubleshoot the growing number of heterogeneous network components has also increased significantly. Often times, scheduled and ad-hoc configuration changes lead to potential configuration errors, policy violations, inefficiencies, and vulnerable states. The current network management landscape offers a variety of configuration auditing tools to reduce risks and achieve compliance. However; they mostly operate in an offline fashion and lack real time reporting capabilities. In our previous work, we proposed an Automated Policy Compliance and Change Detection System capable of audit configurations against internal policies or external best practices and provide centralized reporting for monitoring and regulatory purposes in real time. One of the core requirements for our proposed system is a common policy language for expressing device and organizational policies. This paper defines some of the building blocks of the proposed policy language. A common policy language that will ease the enforcement of policies to all components of the network. Furthermore, the proposed common policy language will bring numerous practical advantages, such as lowering implementation overhead, as well as the possibility to use the same or at least similar tools to maintain the policies.","This paper defines some of the building blocks of the proposed policy language, a common policy language that will ease the enforcement of policies to all components of the network and bring numerous practical advantages, such as lowering implementation overhead."
