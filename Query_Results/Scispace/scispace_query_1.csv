Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a set of methodologies which uses code to set up the install packages, virtual machines and networks, and configure environments. A successful IaC implementation and adoption by developers requires a broad set of skills and knowledge. It is DevelopmentOperations’ tactic of provisioning an application’s infrastructure and managing it through binary readable configuration files, instead of any hardware configuration.

"Enterprise SaaS Workloads on New-Generation Infrastructure-as-Code (iac) on Multi-Cloud Platforms","https://scispace.com/paper/enterprise-saas-workloads-on-new-generation-infrastructure-1qohenqhdndz","","","","Sandesh Achar","10.18034/gdeb.v10i2.652","","Cloud Computing has become the primary model used by DevOps practitioners and researchers to provision infrastructure in minimal time. But recently, the traditional method of using a single cloud provider has fallen out of favor due to several limitations regarding performance, compliance rules, geographical reach, and vendor lock-in. To address these issues, industry and academia are implementing multiple clouds (i.e., multi-cloud). However, managing the infrastructure provisioning of enterprise SaaS applications faces several challenges, such as configuration drift and the heterogeneity of cloud providers. This has seen Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) technologies being used to automate the deployment of SaaS applications. IaC facilitates the rapid deployment of new versions of application infrastructures without degrading quality or stability. Therefore, this work presents a vision of uniformly managing the infrastructure provisioning of enterprise SaaS applications that utilize multiple cloud providers. Hence, we introduce an initial design for the IaC-based Multi-Cloud Deployment pattern and discuss how it addresses the relative challenges.","This study proposes an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) framework for uniformly managing enterprise SaaS workloads on multi-cloud platforms, addressing challenges of configuration drift and heterogeneity, and facilitating rapid deployment without compromising quality or stability."

Configuration drift of a group of machines can be managed by defining configuration intent. Intent is defined by defining a configuration baseline comprised of a collection of related configuration rules. Configuration rules include settings, and targets which can be any managed entity that enables reporting of non-compliance at a more granular level. A configuration baseline can be completed by reading configuration rules from one or more well-configured computers. Configuration drift is assessed by comparing actual values to the configuration baseline values and is reported at a managed entity level instead of at a machine level. Remediation, returning the computer to a state of compliance with the configuration baseline, can be performed on demand. Remediations performed over time are retained and applied to a new instance of the service to eliminate configuration drift on the new instance.","In this paper, the authors define a configuration baseline comprised of a collection of related configuration rules, which can be any managed entity that enables reporting of non-compliance at a more granular level."

The introduction of microservices architectures has increased project teams’ infras- tructure responsibilities, making IaC essential for delivering reliable and efficient deployments. IaC enables developers to describe infrastructure in code, simplifying the deployment process. In both large and small businesses, IaC is essen- tial for supporting efficient DevOps processes.The most recent breakthroughs, tools, and techniques in IaC demonstrate a revolutionary impact on software development and deployment workflows. As more businesses adopt cloud-native designs and containerisation technologies, the requirement for automated infrastructure provisioning grows, leading in the growth of IaC tools and methodologies.

This evolution began with basic automation scripts in the 1990s, which offered limited coverage and required extensive maintenance, before progressing through several distinct technological epochs. The emergence of configuration management platforms between 2005-2012 introduced the transformative ""infrastructure as code"" paradigm, enabling version-controlled deployments and reducing configuration drift by over 80%. Cloud orchestration and containerization subsequently accelerated this progression, with enterprises achieving deployment time reductions exceeding 94% and dramatic improvements in operational efficiency. The integration of artificial intelligence represents the latest evolutionary stage, with AIOps platforms detecting anomalies before conventional tools and autonomously resolving routine incidents with exceptional accuracy. Beyond technical benefits, these advancements deliver substantial business value, including accelerated time-to-market, dramatically reduced operational costs, enhanced resilience, improved scalability, and optimized talent utilization. Organizations leveraging advanced automation demonstrate significantly higher profit margins, market share growth, and innovation throughput compared to traditional counterparts.

Further, there is a need for flexible, timely reconfiguration of the infrastructure, e.g., to use pay-per-use infrastructure efficiently based on application load. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the DevOps tool to automate infrastructure. However, modern static IaC solutions only support infrastructures that are deployed and do not change afterward. To implement infrastructures that change dynamically over time, static IaC programs have to be (updated and) re-run, e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline, or configure an external orchestrator that implements the dynamic behavior, e.g., an autoscaler or Kubernetes operator. Both do not capture the dynamic behavior in the IaC program and prevent analyzing and testing the infrastructure configuration jointly with its dynamic behavior. To fill this gap, we envision dynamic IaC, which augments static IaC with the ability to define dynamic behavior within the IaC program. In contrast to static IaC programs, dynamic IaC programs run continuously. They re-evaluate program parts that depend on external signals when these change and automatically adjust the infrastructure accordingly. We implement DIaC as the first dynamic IaC solution and demonstrate it in two realistic use cases of broader relevance. With dynamic IaC, ensuring the program’s correctness is even harder than for static IaC because programs may define many target configurations in contrast to only a few. However, for this reason, it is also more critical. To solve this issue, we propose automated, specialized property-based testing for IaC programs and implement it in ProTI.","In this paper , the authors propose a dynamic infrastructure as code (DIaC) solution, which augments static IaaC with the ability to define dynamic behavior within the IaC program."

Основною метою цього дослідження було оптимізувати розгортання та керування хмарними ресурсами за допомогою практик інфраструктури як коду (IaC). Стаття починається з пояснення фундаментальних принципів інфраструктури як коду, підкреслюючи її переваги з точки зору послідовності, повторюваності та співпраці. Центральне місце в цій методології займає Terraform, інструмент із відкритим кодом, розроблений для декларативного керування конфігурацією. Здатність Terraform визначати компоненти інфраструктури за допомогою простих, зрозумілих для людини файлів конфігурації забезпечує потужний механізм для надання та керування хмарними ресурсами в різних провайдерів. Ключовим моментом реалізації є використання AWS як хмарного провайдера. AWS пропонує широкий спектр послуг, від обчислювальних екземплярів (EC2) до керованих баз даних (RDS) і безсерверних обчислень (Lambda). У статті розглядаються конкретні випадки використання, коли Terraform використовується для автоматизації надання ресурсів AWS, таких як екземпляри EC2 для масштабованих веб-додатків, бакети S3 для зберігання об’єктів і конфігурації VPC для ізоляції мережі. Важливим аспектом, який обговорюється в статті, є керування станом Terraform, який відстежує поточний стан розгорнутих ресурсів і полегшує співпрацю між членами команди. Стратегії обробки файлів стану, включно з конфігураціями віддаленої серверної частини за допомогою Amazon S3 для блокування, вивчаються, щоб забезпечити узгодженість і уникнути конфліктів під час одночасного розгортання. Крім того, стаття стосується модулів Terraform, які інкапсулюють багаторазові конфігурації для різних компонентів інфраструктури, сприяючи багаторазовому використанню коду та зручності обслуговування. Завдяки модульній конфігурації команди можуть стандартизувати найкращі практики та застосовувати політики в різних середовищах, від розробки до виробництва. Інтеграція Terraform з конвеєрами CI/CD автоматизує тестування та розгортання змін інфраструктури, сприяючи гнучкості та зменшуючи ручне втручання. Ця автоматизація не тільки прискорює доставку оновлень інфраструктури, але й підвищує загальну надійність системи за допомогою автоматизованого тестування та механізмів відкату.

By using machine-readable codes, various tasks that previously required time and effort can now be done dynamically with infrastructure as code tools. Although Infrastructure as Code is a technology that brings many advantages and is still at the beginning of its popularity, there are not enough resource in the literature. In this study, the key concepts of Infrastructure as Code technologies are discussed and infrastructure as code tools are systematically examined. The four most used Infrastructure as Code tools were examined in terms of management, language, data representation, code approach, stateful and stateless, architectural perspectives. Also, they were compared over these key concepts.","The four most used Infrastructure as Code tools were examined in terms of management, language, data representation, code approach, stateful and stateless, architectural perspectives and they were compared over these key concepts."

Like other software artifacts, IaC scripts may contain security smells, which are coding patterns that can result in security weaknesses. Automated analysis tools to detect security smells in IaC scripts exist, but they focus on specific technologies such as Puppet, Ansible, or Chef. This means that when the detection of a new smell is implemented in one of the tools, it is not immediately available for the technologies supported by the other tools — the only option is to duplicate the effort. This paper presents an approach that enables consistent security smell detection across different IaC technologies. We conduct a large-scale empirical study that analyzes security smells on three large datasets containing 196,755 IaC scripts and 12,281,251 LOC. We show that all categories of security smells are identified across all datasets and we identify some smells that might affect many IaC projects. To conduct this study, we developed GLITCH, a new technology-agnostic framework that enables automated polyglot smell detection by transforming IaC scripts into an intermediate representation, on which different security smell detectors can be defined. GLITCH currently supports the detection of nine different security smells in scripts written in Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. We compare GLITCH with state-of-the-art security smell detectors. The results obtained not only show that GLITCH can reduce the effort of writing security smell analyses for multiple IaC technologies, but also that it has higher precision and recall than the current state-of-the-art tools.","GLITCH, a new technology-agnostic framework that enables automated polyglot smell detection by transforming IaC scripts into an intermediate representation, on which different security smell detectors can be defined, is developed and compared with state-of-the-art tools."

This approach allows for faster and more homogeneous configuration of a complete infrastructure. Infrastructure as Code languages, such as CloudFormation or TerraForm, use a declarative model so that users only need to describe the desired state of the infrastructure. However, in practice, these languages are not processed atomically. During an upgrade, the infrastructure goes through a series of intermediate states. We identify a security vulnerability that occurs during an upgrade even when the initial and final states of the infrastructure are secure, and we show that those vulnerability are possible in Amazon’s AWS and Google Cloud. We call such attacks intra-update sniping vulnerabilities. In order to mitigate this shortcoming, we present a technique that detects such vulnerabilities and pinpoints the root causes of insecure deployment migrations. We implement this technique in a tool, Hayha, that uses dataflow graph analysis. We evaluate our tool on a set of open-source CloudFormation templates and find that it is scalable and could be used as part of a deployment workflow.","Hayha as mentioned in this paper detects intra-update sniping vulnerabilities and pinpoints the root causes of insecure deployment migrations using dataflow graph analysis, which can be used as part of a deployment workflow."

IaC works best with DevOps practices for code quality, scalability, security, and reliability. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) promotes managing knowledge and experience through reusable scripts of infrastructure code, instead of the traditional method of manual labour technique, which is typically slow and time-consuming. This research determines some security risks that should considered during the IaC development process. It further defines the main security practices that should be added into Infrastructure as Code life cycle to fill the gap in the SDLC for IaC.

Modern software development has evolved to embrace IaC as a best practice for consistently provisioning and managing infrastructure using various tools such as Terraform and Ansible. However, recent studies highlighted that developers still encounter various challenges with IaC tools. Aims. We aim in this paper to understand the different challenges that developers encounter with IaC and analyze the trend of seeking assistance on Q&A platforms in the context of IaC. To this end, we conduct a large-scale empirical study investigating developers' discussions in Stack Overflow. Method. We first collect IaC-relevant tags on Stack Overflow, constituting a dataset that comprises 52,692 questions and 64,078 answers. Then, we group questions into specific topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method, which we optimize using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter's fine-tuning. Finally, to gain better insights, we analyze the identified topics based on different criteria such as popularity and difficulty. Results. Our findings reveal an average yearly increase of 150% in terms of IaC-related questions and 135% in terms of users between 2011 and 2022. Furthermore, we observe that IaC questions revolve around seven main topics: server configuration, policy configuration, networking, deployment pipelines, variable management, templating, and file management. Notably, we found that server configuration and file management are the most popular topics, i.e., the most discussed among IaC developers, while the deployment pipelines and templating topics are the most difficult. Conclusions. Our results shed light on IaC challenges that are often encountered by developers on popular Q&A platforms. These findings reveal important implications for practitioners seeking better support for IaC tools in real-world settings and for researchers to better understand the IaC community needs and further investigate IaC in different aspects.","A large-scale empirical study investigating developers' discussions in Stack Overflow finds that server configuration and file management are the most popular topics, i.e., the most discussed among IaC developers, while the deployment pipelines and templating topics are themost difficult."

The research profile focuses on a methodology known in the professional environment as “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC) and is one of the foundational methodologies implemented in a systemic combination within the DevOps methodology. This methodology is actively used in processes of dynamic formation, deployment, and maintenance of corporate IT infrastructures in many modern successful high-tech companies to achieve the best business performance, efficiency, guaranteed success, and security. The article discusses two basic approaches to building software tools that implement the IaC methodology, namely the declarative and imperative approaches. The main emphasis is placed on the formation of a set of advantages and disadvantages inherent in software tools such as Terraform, ARM, Ansible, and CloudFormation. The focus of researchers on these four software tools is explained by their leading positions in a fairly extensive lineup of possible alternative software products that allow for a comprehensive implementation of the IaC methodology in the context of full and functional systemic deployment of the DevOps methodology in specific implementations of corporate IT infrastructures. The authors' generalized conclusion of original scientific research is that there is currently no single clearly distinguished universal software tool among others that fully satisfies the entire spectrum of requirements and needs. Potential users in this context are communities of DevOps professionals and clients – owners and managers of modern dynamic high- tech and successful companies, firms, and businesses that rely on modern information systems and technologies.

Objective: From a maintenance and evolution perspective, the topic has picked the interest of practitioners and academics alike, given the relative scarcity of supporting patterns and practices in the academic literature. At the same time, a considerable amount of gray literature exists on IaC. Thus we aim to characterize IaC and compile a catalog of best and bad practices for widely used IaC languages, all using gray literature materials. Method: In this paper, we systematically analyze the industrial gray literature on IaC, such as blog posts, tutorials, white papers using qualitative analysis techniques. Results: We proposed a definition for IaC and distilled a broad catalog summarized in a taxonomy consisting of 10 and 4 primary categories for best practices and bad practices, respectively, both language-agnostic and language-specific ones, for three IaC languages, namely Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. The practices reflect implementation issues, design issues, and the violation of/adherence to the essential principles of IaC. Conclusion: Our findings reveal critical insights concerning the top languages as well as the best practices adopted by practitioners to address (some of) those challenges.

We propose that software deployed on a public or private cloud should, to the furthest possible extent, be immutable and source controlled. This reduces configuration drift and ensures no configuration problems in production as a result of updates or changes. We will show an example of a software project deployed on Amazon Web Services with an immutable Jenkins setup which manages updating the whole cluster and is self-regenerating.

Writing IaC, however, is not an easy task, since it requires blending different infrastructure programming languages and abstractions, each specialized on a particular aspect of infrastructure creation, configuration, and management. Moreover, the more the architectures become large and complex (e.g. Data-Intensive or Microservice-based architectures), the more dire the need of IaC becomes. The goal of this paper is to exploit Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) to create language-agnostic models that are then automatically transformed into IaC. We focus on the domain of Data-Intensive Applications as these typically exploit complex infrastructures which demand sophisticated and fine-grained configuration and re-configuration — we show that, through our approach, called DICER, it is possible to create complex IaC with significant amounts of time savings, both in IaC design as well as deployment and re-deployment times.","The goal of this paper is to exploit Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) to create language-agnostic models that are then automatically transformed into Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with significant amounts of time savings, both in IaC design as well as deployment and re-deployment times."

IaC has a lot of potential in cloud computing as it results in a significant saving of time when an application needs to be redeployed on a different set of resources, even running on different infrastructures. Unfortunately, IaC still suffers from some important issues, such as the large variety of competing tools or the strong orientation toward the cloud, leaving aside e.g. the edge. Also, trustworthiness and security aspects of are often left for the end of the cycle, where errors and vulnerabilities are often too late or too expensive to correct. We present here the PIACERE project, which provides tools, methods and techniques for the Infrastructure-as-Code approach. The project will make the creation of IaC more accessible to designers, developers and operators, increasing the quality, security, trustworthiness and evolvability of infrastructural code while ensuring its business continuity by providing self-healing mechanisms anticipation of failures and violations.","The PIACERE project is presented, which provides tools, methods and techniques for the Infrastructure-as-Code approach to make the creation of IaC more accessible to designers, developers and operators, increasing the quality, security, trustworthiness and evolvability of infrastructural code while ensuring its business continuity by providing self-healing mechanisms anticipation of failures and violations."

The IaC approach supports code-centric tools that use scripts to specify the creation, updating and execution of cloud infrastructure resources. Since each cloud provider offers a different type of infrastructure, the definition of an infrastructure resource (e.g., a virtual machine) implies writing several lines of code that greatly depend on the target cloud provider. Model-driven tools, meanwhile, abstract the complexity of using IaC scripts through the high-level modeling of the cloud infrastructure. In a previous work, we presented an infrastructure modeling approach and tool (Argon) for cloud provisioning that leverages model-driven engineering and supports the IaC approach. The objective of the present work is to compare a model-driven tool (Argon) with a well-known code-centric tool (Ansible) in order to provide empirical evidence of their effectiveness when defining the cloud infrastructure, and the participants' perceptions when using these tools. We, therefore, conducted a family of three experiments involving 67 Computer Science students in order to compare Argon with Ansible as regards their effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. We used the AB/BA crossover design to configure the individual experiments and the linear mixed model to statistically analyze the data collected and subsequently obtain empirical findings. The results of the individual experiments and meta-analysis indicate that Argon is more effective as regards supporting the IaC approach in terms of defining the cloud infrastructure. The participants also perceived that Argon is easier to use and more useful for specifying the infrastructure resources. Our findings suggest that Argon accelerates the provisioning process by modeling the cloud infrastructure and automating the generation of scripts for different DevOps tools when compared to Ansible, which is a code-centric tool that is greatly used in practice.","The findings suggest that Argon accelerates the provisioning process by modeling the cloud infrastructure and automating the generation of scripts for different DevOps tools when compared to Ansible, which is a code-centric tool that is greatly used in practice."

However, migrating IT infrastructure to the cloud presents significant challenges, particularly for organizations with limited budgets, dependency on costly proprietary cloud tools, complex migration procedures, and a lack of technical expertise. These obstacles are especially evident in regions like Africa, where the adoption of cloud solutions remains restricted due to financial and technical barriers. This research tackles these challenges by developing and implementing an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) template tailored for cost-effective cloud infrastructure management, using Microsoft Azure as a case study. The project developed and tested a reusable IaC template using tools like Terraform, Visual Studio Code, and Azure CLI. It optimized costs with a monitoring bash script that was executed on one of the Linux-based virtual machines that was created on the Azure portal during the implementation of IaC and ensured reliability via extensive validation thereby reducing the deployment time and costs by approximately 90% as compared to standard Azure configurations. The proposed solution harnesses open-source tools and industry best practices to streamline cloud resource deployment and management, reducing the reliance on expensive inbuilt services and lowering the technical barriers to cloud adoption. By automating the infrastructure provisioning process, the IaC template enables companies to efficiently manage their cloud environments, optimize costs by approximately 30% on infrastructure management, incur 0% costs on resource monitoring and maintain flexibility. The initiative is focused on empowering businesses in resource-constrained environments to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities without incurring prohibitive expenses. It addresses key issues such as budget constraints, technical complexities, and inefficient management practices, providing a pathway for wider cloud adoption in economically developing regions. The research contributes valuable insights into how organizations can achieve low-cost, scalable, and efficient cloud infrastructure operations. The findings have the potential to significantly impact cloud technology adoption across various industries, enabling companies, particularly in developing regions, to leverage cloud solutions to enhance their competitiveness and operational efficiency ","This research develops an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) template for cost-effective cloud infrastructure management on Microsoft Azure, leveraging open-source tools and industry best practices to optimize costs, reduce deployment time, and streamline cloud resource deployment and management."

Instead, IT organizations heavily rely on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies, to automate the provisioning, configuration, and maintenance of computing infrastructures and systems. IaC systems typically offer declarative, domain-specific languages (DSLs) that allow system administrators and developers to write high-level programs that specify the desired state of their infrastructure in a reliable, predictable, and documented fashion. Just like traditional programs, IaC software is not immune to faults, with issues ranging from deployment failures to critical misconfigurations that often impact production systems used by millions of end users. Surprisingly, despite its crucial role in global infrastructure management, the tooling and techniques for ensuring IaC reliability still have room for improvement. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 360 bugs identified in IaC software within prominent IaC ecosystems including Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. Our work is the first in-depth exploration of bug characteristics in these widely-used IaC environments. Through our analysis we aim to understand: (1) how these bugs manifest, (2) their underlying root causes, (3) their reproduction requirements in terms of system state (e.g., operating system versions) or input characteristics, and (4) how these bugs are fixed. Based on our findings, we evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques for IaC reliability, identify their limitations, and provide a set of recommendations for future research.

DOML is a modelling approach that can be mapped into multiple IaC languages, addressing infrastructure provisioning, application deployment and configuration at once. The idea behind DOML is to use a single modelling paradigm which can help to reduce the need of deep technical expertise in using different specialised IaC languages. We present the DOML’s principles and discuss the related work on IaC languages. We demonstrate the DOML advantages for the end-user in comparison with state-of-the-art IaC languages such as Ansible, Terraform, and Cloudify, and show its effectiveness through an example.

IaC relies on source code files rather than manual configuration to manage the infrastructure of a software system. Terraform, an IaC tool and its declarative configuration language named HCL, has recently garnered considerable attention among IaC practitioners. Like other software artefacts, Terraform files could be affected by misconfigurations, faults, and smells. Therefore, DevOps practitioners might benefit from a quality assurance tool to help them perform quality assurance activities on Terrafrom artefacts. This paper introduces TerraMetrics, an open-source tool designed to characterize the quality of Terraform artefacts by providing a catalogue of 40 quality metrics. TerraMetrics leverages the Terraform Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract the metric list, offering a potentially enduring solution compared to conventional regular expressions. This tool comprises three main components: (i) a parser transforming HCL code into an AST, (ii) visitors that traverse the AST nodes to extract the metrics, and (iii) collectors for storing the collected metrics in JSON format. The TerraMetrics tool is publicly available as an Open Source tool, with a demo video, at: https://github.com/stilab-ets/terametrics.

The goal of this paper is to help practitioners improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by developing a defect taxonomy for IaC scripts through qualitative analysis. We develop a taxonomy of IaC defects by applying qualitative analysis on 1,448 defect-related commits collected from open source software (OSS) repositories of the Openstack organization.

We quantify the frequency of identified defect categories by analyzing 80,425 commits collected from 291 OSS repositories spanning across 2005 to 2019. Our defect taxonomy for IaC consists of eight categories, including a category specific to IaC called idempotency (i.e., defects that lead to incorrect system provisioning when the same IaC script is executed multiple times). We observe the surveyed 66 practitioners to agree most with idempotency. The most frequent defect category is configuration data i.e., providing erroneous configuration data in IaC scripts.

Despite the proliferation of cloud service providers, the issue of vendor lock-in continues to pose significant challenges. Recent service disruptions have underscored the perils of exclusive reliance on a single provider. Existing cloud orchestration tools, while designed to mitigate these issues by facilitating deployments across multiple cloud providers, are often bound to provider-specific models. This necessitates users' familiarity with the unique offerings of each provider and may limit adaptability in the face of errors. To address these challenges, a custom wrapper is proposed that operates on top of Terraform, a leading Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool. This wrapper enables diverse cloud deployments through a customized configuration file, simplifying the process of auditing, configuring, and securing various deployments. Practical experiments confirm the seamless deployment of infrastructure across various cloud providers, notably AWS and Azure. Specifically, the successful deployment of a Linux VM on both platforms showcases the adaptability of the approach to diverse cloud environments. The solution also maintains an easy learning curve, ensuring accessibility and industry-friendliness for users managing infrastructure across different cloud providers.","Streamlining multi-cloud infrastructure orchestration with Terraform-based custom wrapper simplifies deployments across various platforms, mitigating vendor lock-in challenges and enhancing adaptability."

Their reliability is crucial because their failure prevents the deployment of applications, and incorrect behavior can introduce malfunction and severe security issues. Yet, software engineering tools to develop reliable programs, such as testing and verification, are barely used in IaC. In fact, we observed that developers mainly rely on integration testing, a slow and expensive practice that can increase confidence in end-to-end functionality but is infeasible to systematically test IaC programs in various configurations—which is required to ensure robustness. On the other hand, fast testing techniques, such as unit testing, are cumbersome with IaC programs because, today, they require significant coding overhead while only providing limited confidence.To solve this issue, we envision the automated testing tool ProTI, reducing the manual overhead and boosting confidence in the test results. ProTI embraces modern unit testing techniques to test IaC programs in many different configurations. Out of the box, ProTI is a fuzzer for Pulumi TypeScript IaC programs, randomly testing the program in many different configurations for termination, configuration correctness, and existing policy compliance. Then developers can add specifications to their program to guide random-based value generation, test additional properties, and add further mocking, making ProTI a property-based testing tool. Lastly, we aim at automatically verifying IaC-specific properties, e.g., access paths between resources.","ProTI as mentioned in this paper is a fuzzer for Pulumi TypeScript IaC programs, randomly testing the program in many different configurations for termination, configuration correctness, and existing policy compliance."

Despite wide adoption, developing and maintaining high-quality IaC artifacts is still challenging. This paper proposes an approach to handling the fine-grained and frequently occurring IaC code errors. The approach extracts code changes from historical commits and clusters them into groups, by constructing a feature model of code changes and employing an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It identifies error patterns from the clusters and proposes a set of inspection rules to check the potential IaC code errors. In practice, we take Puppet code artifacts as subject objects and perform a comprehensive study on 14 popular Puppet artifacts.

Despite reported benefits, IaC scripts are susceptible to defects. Defects in IaC scripts can cause serious consequences, for example, creating large-scale outages similar to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) incident in 2017. The prevalence of defects in IaC scripts necessitates practitioners to implement IaC testing and be aware of IaC testing practices. A synthesis of IaC testing practices can enable practitioners in early mitigation of IaC defects and also help researchers to identify potential research avenues. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by identifying a set of testing practices for IaC scripts. We apply open coding on 50 Internet artifacts, such as blog posts to derive IaC testing practices. We identify six testing practices that include behavior-focused test coverage, the practice of measuring coverage of IaC test cases in terms of expected behavior. We conclude our paper by discussing how practitioners and researchers can leverage our derived list of testing practices for IaC.","The goal of this paper is to help practitioners improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by identifying a set of testing practices for IaC scripts, and identifies six testing practices that include behavior-focused test coverage."

This automation is done through code-based specification files, commonly known as IaC files. Similarly to other code files, IaC files can suffer from violations of established implementation and design standards, i.e., IaC smells. Although prior research has studied various aspects of traditional smells in non-IaC artifacts, there is little knowledge of how IaC smells are prevalent, co-occurring, and impacting the change and defect proneness of IaC code. To fill this gap, we conduct an empirical study encompassing 82 Puppet-based open-source projects. Our investigation focused on 12 types of IaC smells in both implementation and design levels. Our findings reveal that IaC smells do not manifest uniformly, as IaC smells that are particularly associated with modularity issues, exhibit high prevalence rates across projects. Additionally, we found that 74% of IaC files are smelly and over 52% of the smelly IaC files have at least two co-occurring IaC smells. Furthermore, our findings highlight that, on average, smelly IaC files are modified nearly 3.8 times, in terms of number of commits, more frequently than non-smelly IaC files. Furthermore, smelly IaC files are found to be 3.1 times more prone to larger code changes, in terms of code churn, than non-smelly IaC files. Additionally, we found that smelly IaC files are 3.3 times more prone to the introduction of defects that are likely to persist in 1.65 more commits before being fixed than non-smelly IaC files. These findings advocate developers to be more aware of IaC smells in their projects and consider their correction.","The findings reveal that IaC smells do not manifest uniformly, as IaC smells that are particularly associated with modularity issues, exhibit high prevalence rates across projects and advocate developers to be more aware of IaC smells in their projects and consider their correction."
