In a server farm, for example, many different machines may be identically configured to work in conjunction with each other to provide an electronic service (serving web pages, processing electronic payment transactions, etc.). Over time, however, one or more of these systems may drift from previous behavior. Early drift detection can be important, especially in large enterprises, to avoiding costly downtime. Changes in a computer's configuration files, network connections, and/or executable processes can indicate ongoing drift, but collecting this information at scale can be difficult.

Volker Lohweg","10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502571","","Multisensor systems are susceptible to sensor ageing effects as well as to environmental changes. Due to these effects, the distribution of sensor measurements may change over time, which is referred to as sensor drift. A multisensor system which adapts to drift by self-monitoring is more durable, requires less manual maintenance, and provides information of higher quality. This contribution proposes an approach for detecting and adapting to sensor drift. The proposed detection algorithm determines the reliability of a sensor based on fuzzy pattern classifiers and a consistency measure. By this means, the inherent redundancy in multisensor systems is exploited to detect drift. Detected drift leads then to a retraining of the classifier on batched data guided by information fusion. The retraining incorporates the estimated magnitude of the drift. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in comparison with state-of-the-art methods in the scope of a publicly available dataset. It is shown that the drift detection algorithm yields results similar to the benchmark algorithm but is less computationally complex. Relearning with the drift-adapted approach results in more robust classifiers with regard to potential future drift.","The drift detection algorithm yields results similar to the benchmark algorithm but is less computationally complex and relearning with the drift-adapted approach results in more robust classifiers with regard to potential future drift."

Early detection of business process changes enables managers to identify and act upon changes that may otherwise affect process performance. Business process drift detection refers to a family of methods to detect changes in a business process by analyzing event logs extracted from the systems that support the execution of the process. Existing methods for business process drift detection are based on an explorative analysis of a potentially large feature space and in some cases they require users to manually identify specific features that characterize the drift. Depending on the explored feature space, these methods miss various types of changes. Moreover, they are either designed to detect sudden drifts or gradual drifts but not both. This paper proposes an automated and statistically grounded method for detecting sudden and gradual business process drifts under a unified framework. An empirical evaluation shows that the method detects typical change patterns with significantly higher accuracy and lower detection delay than existing methods, while accurately distinguishing between sudden and gradual drifts.","In this article, the authors propose an automated and statistically grounded method for detecting sudden and gradual business process drifts under a unified framework, which detects typical change patterns with significantly higher accuracy and lower detection delay than existing methods."

This is a significant concern for ML-enabled devices in clinical settings, where data drift may cause unexpected performance that jeopardizes patient safety. Method: We propose a ML-enabled Statistical Process Control (SPC) framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and drift monitoring. SPC is advantageous as it visually and statistically highlights deviations from the expected distribution. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for monitoring data drift in radiological images, we investigated different design choices, including methods for extracting feature representations, drift quantification, and SPC parameter selection. Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for two tasks: 1) differentiating axial vs. non-axial computed tomography (CT) images and 2) separating chest x-ray (CXR) from other modalities. For both tasks, we achieved high accuracy in detecting OOD inputs, with 0.913 in CT and 0.995 in CXR, and sensitivity of 0.980 in CT and 0.984 in CXR. Our framework was also adept at monitoring data streams and identifying the time a drift occurred. In a simulation with 100 daily CXR cases, we detected a drift in OOD input percentage from 0-1% to 3-5% within two days, maintaining a low false-positive rate. Through additional experimental results, we demonstrate the framework's data-agnostic nature and independence from the underlying model's structure. Conclusion: We propose a framework for OOD detection and drift monitoring that is agnostic to data, modality, and model. The framework is customizable and can be adapted for specific applications.","A ML-enabled Statistical Process Control (SPC) framework for OOD detection and drift monitoring that is agnostic to data, modality, and model is proposed and can be adapted for specific applications."

Existing solutions generally monitor cloud platform at different layers and then detect anomalies based on rules or learning algorithms on monitoring metrics. However, complexity of nowadays cloud platforms, high dynamics of cloud workloads and thousands of various types of metrics make anomalous behavior detection more challenging to be applied in production, especially in large scale cloud production environments. In this paper, we present a practical cloud anomalous behavior detection system called DriftInsight. It firstly analyzes multi-denominational metrics of each component and identifies a set of representative steady components based on the convergences of their states. Then it generates a state model and a state transit model for each steady cloud component. Finally, it detects behavior anomalies of these steady components in near real-time and meanwhile evolve behavior models on the fly. The evaluation results of this approach in a commercial large-scale PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) cloud are demonstrated its capability and efficiency.","This paper presents a practical cloud anomalous behavior detection system called DriftInsight that firstly analyzes multi-denominational metrics of each component and identifies a set of representative steady components based on the convergences of their states, and detects behavior anomalies of these steady components in near real-time and meanwhile evolve behavior models on the fly."

Hervé Rivano","10.1109/TASE.2022.3182289","","In recent years, low-cost sensors have raised strong interest for environmental monitoring applications. These instruments often suffer from degraded data quality. Notably, they are prone to drift. It can be mitigated with costly periodic calibrations. To reduce this cost, in situ calibration strategies have emerged, enabling the recalibration of instruments while leaving them in the field. However, they rarely identify which instruments actually need a calibration because of drift, so that in situ calibration may instead degrade performances. Therefore, a novel drift detection algorithm is presented in this work, exploiting the concept of rendez-vous between measuring instruments. Its originality lies mainly in the comparisons of values determining the state of the instruments, for which the quality of the measurement results is taken into account. It defines the concept of compatibility between measurement results. A case study is developed, showing an accuracy of 88% for correct detection of drifting instruments. The results of the diagnosis algorithm are then combined with calibration approaches. Results show a significant improvement of the measurement results. Notably, an increase of 15% of the coefficient of determination of the linear regression between their true values and the measured values is observed with the correction and the error on the slope and on the intercept respectively is reduced by 50% and 60% at least. Note to Practitioners—In this paper, we investigate the problem of drift detection in sensor networks. This work was motivated by the fact that faulty nodes are rarely detected in existing in situ calibration algorithm prior to the correction of the instruments. Moreover, existing fault diagnosis algorithms for sensor networks do not specifically target drift and are often applicable to either (dense) static or mobile sensor networks but not both. We propose an algorithm designed for the detection of drift faults regardless of the type of sensor network and of the measurand. Specific attention is paid to the metrological quality of the measurement results used to carry out the diagnosis. The output of the algorithm provides information that can be exploited for the recalibration of faulty instruments. In future work, we will aim at providing tools and recommendations for the adjusment of the parameters of the diagnosis algorithm but also more elaborated approaches based on the results of our diagnosis algorithm to calibrate faulty nodes.","In this paper , a rendez-vous-based drift detection algorithm was proposed to detect drift in sensor networks, which is based on the concept of compatibility between measurement results and the quality of the measurement results."

Therefore, one of the main focus for monitoring the model should be towards identifying the drifts in the data that might affect the performance of the model. The traditional drift detecting methods are usually based on some assumptions related to the underlying data such as no inter-dependence. However industrial sensor data typically consists of time series data, which is collected at regular intervals. Therefore, detecting drift in dependent data where the current readings depend on the previously registered readings demands a different approach. Existing solutions require either the ground truth, a fixed size, or the underlying model details. We propose an Unsupervised Drift Detection method for industrial Time series data or UDDT, a generic approach with no such pre-requisites. In our approach, we can check whether two series belong to the same model. Apart from detecting the drift in the two series, it can also provide the rationale behind the observed drift, i.e., whether the drift is due to a difference in stationarity, correlation structures, or noise distributions. We evaluate the UDDT on two datasets to demonstrate its correctness and the trust regions under various circumstances. We also establish its applicability for the real industrial setting.","This work proposes an Unsupervised Drift Detection method for industrial Time series data or UDDT, a generic approach with no such pre-requisites, which can check whether two series belong to the same model and provide the rationale behind the observed drift."

Specifically, we monitor the Fisher score vector, defined as the gradient of the log-likelihood for the fitted model, using a form of multivariate exponentially weighted moving average, which monitors for general changes in the mean of a random vector. In spite of the substantial performance advantages that we demonstrate over popular error-based methods, a score-based approach has not been previously considered for concept drift monitoring. Advantages of the proposed score-based framework include applicability to any parametric model, more powerful detection of changes as shown in theory and experiments, and inherent diagnostic capabilities for helping to identify the nature of the changes.","A comprehensive and computationally efficient framework for detecting, monitoring, and diagnosing concept drift monitoring is developed using the Fisher score vector, defined as the gradient of the log-likelihood for the fitted model, using a form of multivariate exponentially weighted moving average."

In a live environment, with evolving data, the risk is for the model to become ill-adapted for the given situation. The failure to detect drift while leading to a performance deterioration could also cause side effects due to model over-trust. Informing the user of any anomaly upon detection is the key to enabling any action. We propose Shap-ADWIN, a novel approach improving the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors such as ADWIN by leveraging the information brought by Shapley Loss Values. While common practice is to monitor the evolution of the loss of models at most for every predicted instance, the proposed solution monitors each individual instance and features the Shapley Loss value. Whenever the loss is attributed more toward a given feature the information becomes more contrasted, which enables a better detection. Indeed the signal-to-noise ratio is higher on that feature and allows the detector to leverage that information. The opposite case being equal Shapley values that are just the Loss under-scaled for every feature. Moreover, noise over the output would be equally distributed along with each Shapley Loss value of every feature providing lower information to noise ratio and allows a more reliable detection. We provide: a restricted proof, experiments and source code. Results were obtained using synthetically generated data presenting diverse types of drift, showing the performance of Shap-ADWIN over ADWIN.

We consider that selecting a proper drift threshold could be more important than developing a new drift detection algorithm, and different drift detection algorithms may end up with very similar performance with aligned drift thresholds. To better understand this process, we propose a novel threshold selection algorithm to align the drift thresholds of a set of algorithms so that they are all at the same sensitivity level.

Current drift detection methods, focusing on prediction performance or data distribution, often neglect temporal dependencies and require prior distribution assumptions. These limitations have catalyzed the development of dynamic theory-based approaches that identify drifts by discerning variations in data dynamics. However, the majority of these exhibit high complexity in dynamics characterization and still underperform in industrial drift detection. To overcome these challenges, we propose a singular spectrum analysis-based drift detection method for industry data streams, comprising three modules: common dynamics extraction, noise-robust drift detection, and threshold adaptation. Our approach uses singular spectrum analysis (SSA) as the dynamics representation method instead of traditional high-dimensional phase space embedding and Fourier transform. SSA allows for the efficient description of principal dynamics by intelligently mixing the Fourier basis functions according to given data. The first two modules are specifically engineered to address the common dynamics and stochastic noise inherent in industrial data streams through a well-designed online common dynamics extraction algorithm and a noise-robust detection index respectively. Threshold adaptation module provides a more reasonable way of updating the drift threshold based on the extreme value theory, ensuring global consistency for parameter estimation of extreme value distribution. Our proposed method was tested on simulated examples and a real-world sintering process, exhibiting enhanced drift detection performance.

If left unaddressed, model drift can lead to inaccurate predictions, biased outcomes, and poor business decisions. To mitigate this risk, automated model monitoring and real-time retraining are essential in modern ML pipelines. Model drift can manifest in several forms, including concept drift, where the relationship between features and labels changes; covariate shift, where the distribution of input features evolves; and label drift, where the frequency of class labels varies over time. Detecting and addressing model drift is crucial for maintaining model accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications such as financial fraud detection, healthcare diagnostics, and predictive maintenance. This paper explores various methodologies for detecting model drift, including statistical techniques, drift detection algorithms, and real-time anomaly detection frameworks. We discuss key performance monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, AWS SageMaker Model Monitor, and Evidently AI that facilitate proactive drift identification. Additionally, we highlight strategies for implementing automated model retraining pipelines using MLOps frameworks like Kubeflow, Apache Airflow, and MLflow, ensuring seamless integration with production environments. A significant focus is placed on real-time retraining approaches, where model updates are triggered dynamically based on performance metrics, drift thresholds, and adaptive learning mechanisms. We analyze trade-offs between scheduled vs. event-driven retraining, discuss CI/CD workflows for ML models, and present case studies that showcase the impact of drift management in real-world applications. Finally, we address challenges associated with automated drift mitigation, including computational cost, ethical considerations, and data latency issues. Future research directions explore the role of federated learning, large-scale reinforcement learning, and AI-augmented drift detection techniques to enhance robustness in continuously evolving ML systems. Through a comprehensive study of model drift detection and mitigation strategies, this paper aims to provide actionable insights for data scientists, MLOps engineers, and AI practitioners to build resilient, self-healing ML pipelines that sustain performance in dynamic data environments.

Existing approaches, such as relation-based precedence rules, tuned to detect drifts in the process structure are often not well suited to detecting changes in customer behaviour. This paper proposes a concept drift detector employing multi-components originating from Discrete-time Markov chains to detect, localize and reason about concept drifts in both process structure and customer behaviour of the control-flow. The approach was compared with three commonly used methods using 52 artificial event logs representing various types of drift (sudden and gradual, structural and behavioural). Experimental results demonstrated desirable performance with average F1 scores of 0.871 and 0.893 under structural and behavioural drifts, respectively. The approach was also employed in a real-life hospital billing dataset. The main contribution of this paper is a concept drift detector that is able to detect and explain root causes of control-flow changes whether such variations occurred suddenly or gradually. • A method for detecting sudden and gradual drifts in process event data. • The method can detect structural and behavioural process drifts. • A sliding window framework associated with the proposed drift detector. • The method can detect, localize and rationalize process drifts.

Early detection of business process drifts from event logs enables analysts to identify changes that may negatively affect process performance. However, detecting a process drift without characterizing its nature is not enough to support analysts in understanding and rectifying process performance issues. We propose a method to characterize process drifts from event streams, in terms of the behavioral relations that are modified by the drift. The method builds upon a technique for online drift detection, and relies on a statistical test to select the behavioral relations extracted from the stream that have the highest explanatory power. The selected relations are then mapped to typical change patterns to explain the detected drifts. An extensive evaluation on synthetic and real-life logs shows that our method is fast and accurate in characterizing process drifts, and performs significantly better than alternative techniques.","In this article, the authors proposed a method to characterize process drifts from event streams, in terms of the behavioral relations that are modified by the drift, and mapped the selected relations to typical change patterns to explain the detected drifts."

In a dynamic clinical environment, these devices may encounter conditions different from those they were developed for. The statistical data mismatch between training/initial testing and production is often referred to as data drift. Detecting and quantifying data drift is significant for ensuring that AI model performs as expected in clinical environments. A drift detector signals when a corrective action is needed if the performance changes. In this study, we investigate how a change in the performance of an AI model due to data drift can be detected and quantified using a cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart. To study the properties of CUSUM, we first simulate different scenarios that change the performance of an AI model. We simulate a sudden change in the mean of the performance metric at a change-point (change day) in time. The task is to quickly detect the change while providing few false-alarms before the change-point, which may be caused by the statistical variation of the performance metric over time. Subsequently, we simulate data drift by denoising the Emory Breast Imaging Dataset (EMBED) after a pre-defined change-point. We detect the change-point by studying the pre- and post-change specificity of a mammographic CAD algorithm. Our results indicate that with the appropriate choice of parameters, CUSUM is able to quickly detect relatively small drifts with a small number of false-positive alarms.","Quantifying data drift in medical AI models using a cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart is feasible and effective."

Due to the damage to machine components, manufacturing processes degrade over time, resulting in substandard products. Generally, statistical process control tools such as control charts aid in identifying patterns and trends indicative of process changes. This investigation delves into the effectiveness of cumulative sum control charts using the sample mean and median as plotting statistics. Run-length measurements assess performance after the charts experience linear and quadratic drifts in non-normal setups under zero- and steady-state conditions. The findings reveal that Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts outperform zero-state monitoring compared to steady-state monitoring. Notably, the CUSUM chart for the mean is suitable for normal and Gamma distributions, exhibiting a greater ability for drift detection under biased and unbiased Average Run Lengths. This study offers valuable insights into enhancing manufacturing quality through effectively implementing and comparing Shewhart, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, and CUSUM charts. By evaluating their performance under various conditions and comparing them with other control chart methods, this research provides valuable guidance for industries seeking to improve process monitoring and product quality. It is essential to acknowledge that the findings are based on specific experimental conditions and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world manufacturing environments. For practical purposes, the suggested charts are also applied to real-world case studies, including air quality (focusing on five metal oxide chemistry sensors: carbon monoxide concentration, non-metonic hydrocarbons, benzene, total nitrogen oxides, and nitrogen dioxide) and maintenance data (including air temperature, rotating speed, and equipment failure).

Concept drift makes the learning process complicated because of the inconsistency between existing data and upcoming data. Since concept drift was first proposed, numerous articles have been published to address this issue in terms of distribution analysis. However, most distributionbased drift detection methods assume that a drift happens at an exact time point, and the data arrived before that time point is considered not important. Thus, if a drift only occurs in a small region of the entire feature space, the other non-drifted regions may also be suspended, thereby reducing the learning efficiency of models. To retrieve nondrifted information from suspended historical data, we propose a local drift degree (LDD) measurement that can continuously monitor regional density changes. Instead of suspending all historical data after a drift, we synchronize the regional density discrepancies according to LDD. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark data sets show that our concept drift adaptation algorithm improves accuracy compared to other methods.","This work proposes a local drift degree (LDD) measurement that can continuously monitor regional density changes and synchronizes the regional density discrepancies according to LDD to retrieve nondrifted information from suspended historical data."

Secondly, we propose using feature store entities, SHAP values, and Collaborative Filtering (CF) to augment unlabeled data across multiple models. To the best of our knowledge, QuaD is the first work that examines the collective behavior of concept drift across multiple models and discerns associations between models that may share a susceptibility in a dynamic setting.

The GLR drift chart does not require specification of any tuning parameters by the practitioner and has the advantage that, at the time of the signal, estimates of both the change point and the drift size are immediately available. An equation to accurately approximate the control limit is provided. The performance of the GLR drift chart is compared with that of other control charts such as a standard cumulative sum chart and a cumulative score chart designed for drift detection. We also compare the GLR chart designed for drift detection with the GLR chart designed for sustained shift detection because both of them require only a control limit to be specified. In terms of the expected time for detection and in terms of the bias and mean squared error of the change-point estimators, the GLR drift chart has better performance for a wide range of drift rates relative to the GLR shift chart when the out-of-control process is truly a linear drift.

The problem of adaptation becomes more difficult when the changes are asynchronous, i.e., when peers experience drifts at different times. We address this problem by developing an ensemble approach, PINE, that combines reactive adaptation via drift detection, and proactive handling of upcoming changes via early warning and adaptation across the peers. With empirical study on simulated and real-world data sets, we show that PINE handles asynchronous concept drifts better and faster than current state-of-the-art approaches, which have been designed to work in less challenging environments. In addition, PINE is parameter insensitive and incurs less communication cost while achieving better accuracy.","This work develops an ensemble approach, PINE, that combines reactive adaptation via drift detection, and proactive handling of upcoming changes via early warning and adaptation across the peers that handles asynchronous concept drifts better and faster than current state-of-the-art approaches."

Several schemes have been proposed to attack this challenging problem [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The central notion of all these efforts is to detect the change point where the data mining model deviates significantly with respect to the data characteristics that it was trained or built on. The process of detecting such change points is often termed as concept drift. Current state of algorithms assume attribute independence, view the problem as a supervised learning problem and also need tagged data. The proposed algorithm does not make any assumption among attribute independence and uses the covariance summary to detect concept drift in an unsupervised setting.

Philipp Cimiano","10.1007/978-3-031-58553-1_7","","Continuous federated learning (CFL), a recently emerging learning paradigm that facilitates collaborative, yet privacy-preserving machine learning (ML), bears the potential to shape the future of distributed ML. In spite of its great potential, it is - similar to continuous ML - prone to suffer from concept drift (a change in data properties over time). In turn, CFL can greatly benefit from employing drift detection to react adequately to emerging drifts. Although various such approaches exist, respective research lacks application of drift detection to CFL with dynamic client participation as well as detailed analysis of the advantages of different drift detection approaches such as error-based or data-based drift detection. To this end, we apply these drift detection approaches to a CFL platform that allows new clients to join even after the training has started and measure the negative impact of concept drift on model performance. Moreover, we uncover distinct differences between the error- and data-based drift detection. In particular, we find the former ones to be more suitable to detect the point in time where the joint models stops benefiting from concept drift whereas the latter allows for a more precise detection of the first occurrence of concept drift. ","This study investigates concept drift in continuous federated learning, applying error-based and data-based drift detection approaches to a dynamic CFL platform, revealing distinct differences and suitability for detecting concept drift and model performance degradation."

An alignment score measures this by quantifying the similarity between the model's predicted and the system's (unknown) actual distributions. An alignment monitor observes the system at runtime; at each point in time it uses the current state and the model to predict the next state. After the next state is observed, the monitor updates the verdict, which is a high-probability interval estimate for the true alignment score. We utilize tools from sequential forecasting to construct our alignment monitors. Besides a monitor for measuring the expected alignment score, we introduce a differential alignment monitor, designed for comparing two models, and a weighted alignment monitor, which permits task-specific alignment monitoring.

However, existing statistical process monitoring methods are often inadequate for addressing the challenges of multivariate multimodal data monitoring. For example, they may require the process data to be unimodal or identically distributed or may assume the information regarding the multimodal processes to be known a priori. Therefore, a data-driven monitoring scheme is proposed in this paper. First, the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model is adopted, which can depend entirely on data characteristics and automatically cluster the data without any prior knowledge. On this basis, an exponentially weighted moving average scheme is then constructed by incorporating the negative log-likelihood statistic. Using thorough simulations and a real example, we analyse and compare the performance of the model estimation and online monitoring for detecting various out-of-control scenarios. Extensive results show that our proposed monitoring scheme is sensitive to not only model parameter shifts but also model order changes. Moreover, the proposed scheme generally performs better and more robustly than existing methods.

Furthermore, we develop a global monitoring scheme using the sum of top-r local statistics, which can quickly detect a wide range of possible shifts in all directions. Simulations and case studies are conducted to evaluate the performance and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. ","Wang et al. as discussed by the authors proposed a generic nonparametric monitoring framework to online monitor high-dimensional asynchronous and heterogeneous data streams, where sampling intervals of data streams are different from each other, and measurements of each data stream follow arbitrary distributions."

Borkowski","10.1109/EMPDP.2004.1271437","","Global states can be used for distributed/parallel application monitoring and control. Strongly consistent global states (SCGS) are especially well suited for on-line controlling. Existing SCGS detecting algorithms work with process local states. They must wait for state terminations before complete states can be taken into account. Because of that the global states seen by a monitor always belong to the past. We present an algorithm, which works with unterminated local states. This approach lets the monitor detect SCGS sooner: currently lasting global states can be perceived promptly after they started. Application control based on SCGS detection should react quicker to arising situations when using the new algorithm. The quick reactions contribute to a better parallel/distributed application performance. Simulation tests confirm these suppositions. Our solution utilizes bounded maximal message transfer time. It is compared with another method, which employs frequent confirmation messages. While both methods can lead to similar application performance, our approach induces a few times lower both monitor load and network traffic.","This approach lets the monitor detect SCGS sooner: currently lasting global states can be perceived promptly after they started, and the quick reactions contribute to a better parallel/distributed application performance."

However, existing methodologies are limited to small classes of functions, requiring non-trivial effort and substantial mathematical sophistication to tailor them to new functions. In this work we present AutoMon, the first general solution to this problem. AutoMon enables automatic, communication-efficient distributed monitoring of arbitrary functions. Given source code that computes a function from centralized data, the AutoMon algorithm approximates the function over the aggregate of distributed data streams, without centralizing data updates. Our evaluation shows that AutoMon sends the same number or fewer messages as state-of-the-art techniques when monitoring specific functions for which a distributed, hand-crafted solution is known. AutoMon, however, is a lot more powerful. It automatically generates a communication-efficient distributed monitoring solution for arbitrary functions, e.g., monitoring deep neural networks inference tasks for which no non-trivial solution is known.","This work presents AutoMon, the first general solution to this problem, which automatically generates a communication-efficient distributed monitoring solution for arbitrary functions, e.g., monitoring deep neural networks inference tasks for which no non-trivial solution is known."

Whereas, in a high-dimensional environment, constructing a CUSUM scheme that is convenient to implement as well as effective is yet to be adequately addressed. In this paper, a distribution-free CUSUM scheme is developed for monitoring high-dimensional processes. The proposed scheme combines the advantage of the nonparametric statistics for jointly monitoring process location and scale with the better shift detection performance of a CUSUM scheme. The theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has satisfactory in-control properties for any distributions with any dimension when only a small reference dataset is available. Control limits in terms of median run length are tabulated for implementation of the proposed chart in practice, and extensive comparative studies have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in detecting shifts in process location or scale or both.","In this article , a distribution-free cumulative sum (CUSUM) scheme is proposed for monitoring high-dimensional processes, which combines nonparametric statistics for jointly monitoring process location and scale with the better shift detection performance of a CUSUM scheme."

Control over false alarms has many practical implications and is rarely guaranteed by online change-detection algorithms that can monitor multivariate datastreams whose distribution is unknown.

Indeed, large-scale industrial systems are currently developed by hundreds of developers working on hundreds of models by different distributed teams. In such a context, model inconsistency detection is gaining a lot of attention as the overlap between all these models, which are often maintained by different persons, are a common source of inconsistencies. This paper proposes a method to detect inconsistencies when models are scattered on different editing sites using partial replication. The method provides a way to check the consistency of a single view against the ones that are related to it regarding consistency. It relies on Praxis, an operation based representation of models, to determine what information needs to be collected for consistency checking and the DPraxis protocol to find where it can be.","A method to detect inconsistencies when models are scattered on different editing sites using partial replication is proposed and provides a way to check the consistency of a single view against the ones that are related to it regarding consistency."

Drift is distribution change between the training and deployment data, which is concerning if model performance changes. For a cat/dog image classifier, for instance, drift during deployment could be rabbit images (new class) or cat/dog images with changed characteristics (change in distribution). We wish to detect these changes but can't measure accuracy without deployment data labels. We instead detect drift indirectly by nonparametrically testing the distribution of model prediction confidence for changes. This generalizes our method and sidesteps domain-specific feature representation.   We address important statistical issues, particularly Type-1 error control in sequential testing, using Change Point Models (CPMs; see Adams and Ross 2012). We also use nonparametric outlier methods to show the user suspicious observations for model diagnosis, since the before/after change confidence distributions overlap significantly. In experiments to demonstrate robustness, we train on a subset of MNIST digit classes, then insert drift (e.g., unseen digit class) in deployment data in various settings (gradual/sudden changes in the drift proportion). A novel loss function is introduced to compare the performance (detection delay, Type-1 and 2 errors) of a drift detector under different levels of drift class contamination.","Researchers develop a nonparametric method to detect data drift and outliers affecting machine learning model performance over time, using prediction confidence distributions and Change Point Models to control Type-1 errors and identify suspicious observations."

We focus on assumptions related to clock synchronization. When a program written with clock synchronization assumptions is monitored to determine if it satisfies its requirements, the monitor should also account for these assumptions precisely. Otherwise, the monitor will either miss potential bugs (false negatives) or find bugs that are inconsistent with these assumptions (false positives). However, if assumptions made by the program are implicit or change over time and are not immediately available to the monitor, such false positives and/or negatives are unavoidable. This paper characterizes precision (probability that the violation identified by the monitor is valid) and recall (probability that the monitor identifies an actual violation) of the monitor based on the gap between clock synchronization assumptions made by the program/application and the clock synchronization assumptions made by the monitor. Our analysis is based on the development of an analytical model for precision, recall and sensitivity of monitors detecting conjunctive predicates. We validate the model via simulations and experiments on the Amazon Web Services platform.","In this paper, an analytical model for detecting conjunctive predicates is developed based on the gap between clock synchronization assumptions made by the program/application and the clock synchronization assumption made by a monitor."

Often, the metrics are acquired from system observations such as static checks and runtime traces. To avoid bias propagation and hence reduce wrong decisions in increasingly autonomous systems due to poor observation data quality, multiple independent observers can exchange their findings and produce a majority-accepted, complete and outlier-cleaned ground truth in the form of consensus-supported metrics. In this work, we motivate the growing importance of metrics for informed and autonomic decisions in clouds and other distributed systems, present reasons for diverging observations, and describe a federated approach to produce ground truth with data-centric consensus voting for more reliable decision making processes. We validate the system design with experiments in the area of cloud software artefact observations and highlight benefits for reproducible distributed system behaviour.

Together with the extension of the application domains, new requirements have emerged for large-scale distributed systems. Among these, fault tolerance is needed by more and more modern distributed applications, not only by the critical ones. In this paper we present a solution aiming at fault tolerant monitoring of the distributed systems within the MonALISA framework. Our approach uses replication and guarantees that all processing replicas achieve state consistency, both in the absence of failures and after failure recovery. We achieve consistency in the former case by implementing a module that ensures that the order of monitoring tuples is the same at all the replicas. To achieve consistency after failure recovery, we rely on check pointing techniques. We address the optimization problem of the replication architecture by dynamically monitoring and estimating inter-replica link throughputs and real-time replica status. We demonstrate the strengths of our solution using the MonALISA monitoring application in a distributed environment. Our tests show that the proposed approach outperforms previous solutions in terms of latency and that it uses system resources efficiently by carefully updating replicas, while keeping overhead very low.","This paper presents a solution aiming at fault tolerant monitoring of the distributed systems within the MonALISA framework that uses replication and guarantees that all processing replicas achieve state consistency, both in the absence of failures and after failure recovery."
