Tucker","","","Drift in the zero or datum reference point of a circuit (such as that forming part of a measuring device) is corrected by sensing the rate of change of the signal provided by the circuit and distinguishing between a rate of change characteristic of that due to a valid signal indicative of a measurement and a rate of change characteristic of that due to drift in the circuit. In one embodiment, a window comparator 18 senses the rate of change of the signal output from circuit 10 by periodically sampling in sample/ hold 16 and then comparing with the current value of the signal. A signal circulating path 20, 21, 22 holds a drift compensating value which is updated when comparator 18 senses a rate of change below a threshold value which is indicative of drift in circuit 10. The drift compensating value is added to the signal from circuit 10 in summing amplifier 15 thereby correcting the signal for drift.","In this article, the drift in the zero or datum reference point of a circuit is corrected by sensing the rate of change of the signal provided by the circuit and distinguishing between a signal characteristic of that due to a valid signal indicative of a measurement and due to drift in a circuit."

Configuration drift of a group of machines can be managed by defining configuration intent. Intent is defined by defining a configuration baseline comprised of a collection of related configuration rules. Configuration rules include settings, and targets which can be any managed entity that enables reporting of non-compliance at a more granular level. A configuration baseline can be completed by reading configuration rules from one or more well-configured computers. Configuration drift is assessed by comparing actual values to the configuration baseline values and is reported at a managed entity level instead of at a machine level. Remediation, returning the computer to a state of compliance with the configuration baseline, can be performed on demand. Remediations performed over time are retained and applied to a new instance of the service to eliminate configuration drift on the new instance.","In this paper, the authors define a configuration baseline comprised of a collection of related configuration rules, which can be any managed entity that enables reporting of non-compliance at a more granular level."

In some cases, the techniques include iterative optimization of the camera poses at selected keyframes captured along the camera trajectory to reduce pose errors. Such iterative optimization may include performing an alignment process using the point cloud of a given keyframe and a point cloud made from one or more overlapping keyframes, such as via an iterative closest point (ICP)-based expectation maximization. The keyframes may then be fused to reconstruct a more accurate model of the scene, discarding the existing model. The new model can then be used for tracking and meshing. In some instances, keyframes may be selected such that the overlap with other keyframes includes enough shape features to allow for alignment with the keyframe depth point cloud. In some cases, the techniques can be performed in a particular order giving precedence to keyframes having smaller pose errors.","In this paper, the keyframes are selected such that the overlap with other keyframes includes enough shape features to allow for alignment with the keyframe depth point cloud, such as via an iterative closest point (ICP)-based expectation maximization."

In distributed systems, e.g. computer networks or mobile networks, the introduction of self-healing capabilities poses some challenges, mainly when software-based networks, e.g. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), are involved. Such networks impose new control and management layers, and the adoption of self-healing functions means that all layers must be considered. In this paper, we present the challenges of self-healing in the scope of SDN and NFV, by revising the self-healing concept in computer and mobile networks, and by presenting the thorough difference between a system that applies fault tolerance from one that applies self-healing functions. We also introduce a framework for solving these challenges, by describing four use cases of self-healing, considering control, management, and data layers. The use cases focus on maintaining the health of the network at run-time, considering control, management, and infrastructure layers. Our framework is a novel Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tool, based on a self-management network architecture that was introduced in our previous works.","In this paper, the authors present the challenges of self-healing in the scope of SDN and NFV, by revising the selfhealing concept in computer and mobile networks, and by presenting the thorough difference between a system that applies fault tolerance from one that applies self healing functions."

Rousseau","10.1002/XRS.582","","A method of correcting for instrumental drift must be associated with any calibration procedure in order to validate the stored calibration data (slopes and intercepts) over a long period of time. Indeed, it can usually be observed that the drift is negligible for a 24 h period, but over longer periods corrections to the measured intensities have to be made. These corrections are based on the measurement of special specimens known as drift monitors or simply monitors. Physically, the monitor can comprise one to several specimens, each containing one or several analytes of which the intensity of each analyte is slightly higher than the highest intensity in the analyte concentration range. The other two essential properties of a monitor are its stability over time and reproducibility of its intensity measurements. A drift correction must be applied to the measured intensities of every analyte using one, two or several monitors depending on the spread of the intensity ranges. Some drift correction methods are proposed and it is explained how to combine them with the calibration procedure in order to obtain precise analytical results over long periods of time from the same set of calibration data.

This evolution began with basic automation scripts in the 1990s, which offered limited coverage and required extensive maintenance, before progressing through several distinct technological epochs. The emergence of configuration management platforms between 2005-2012 introduced the transformative ""infrastructure as code"" paradigm, enabling version-controlled deployments and reducing configuration drift by over 80%. Cloud orchestration and containerization subsequently accelerated this progression, with enterprises achieving deployment time reductions exceeding 94% and dramatic improvements in operational efficiency. The integration of artificial intelligence represents the latest evolutionary stage, with AIOps platforms detecting anomalies before conventional tools and autonomously resolving routine incidents with exceptional accuracy. Beyond technical benefits, these advancements deliver substantial business value, including accelerated time-to-market, dramatically reduced operational costs, enhanced resilience, improved scalability, and optimized talent utilization. Organizations leveraging advanced automation demonstrate significantly higher profit margins, market share growth, and innovation throughput compared to traditional counterparts.

The problem is intuitively appealing as a way to automate the different type of maintenance processes (corrective, adaptive and perfective) and forms an interesting area of research that has inspired many initiatives. As a result, several surveys on self-healing have been published to describe the state of the art in this field. According to those surveys, the major trend towards finding a solution of the self-healing problem relies on redundancy that may concern both architecture and code resources. These approaches are therefore better suited to address adaptive and perfective maintenance. As part of the EU FP7 FastFix project, we focus on self-healing for corrective maintenance. We propose a framework for automating corrective maintenance that is based on software control principles. Our approach automates the engineering of self-healing systems as it does not require the system to be designed in a specific way. Instead it can be applied to legacy systems and automatically equip them with observation and control points. Moreover, the proposed approach relies on a sound control theory developed for Discrete Event Systems. Finally, this paper contributes to the field by introducing challenges to the effective application of this approach to relevant industrial systems. Some of these challenges are currently being tackled within FastFix.","Challenges are introduced to the effective application of the proposed framework for automating corrective maintenance that is based on software control principles, which relies on a sound control theory developed for Discrete Event Systems."

Empirical validation shows dramatic reductions in MTTR, enhanced failure prevention rates, and lower operational overhead.

Maria A. Amer","10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9054179","","Accurate object tracking is a challenging problem due to numerous factors, that may cause the tracker to drift away from the target object. Typically, the output of a tracker is a bounding box (BB); such BB may not well discriminate the object from its background and may not be centered correctly around the object. This paper proposes a method that first detects, at each frame, if a tracker tends to drift by analyzing saliency features of the output BB of a tracker, and then applies automatic seeded object segmentation on the BB to correct the drift once detected. Such segmentation is meant to relocate (recenter) the BB adaptive to the object segmented. As seeds, we propose to use SIFT and salient points conditioned they are non-background pixels. Different than related work, our approach thus models drift external to a base tracker by examining its output BB at each and corrects drift, as needed, by updating that BB adaptive to segmentation. We show the ability of the proposed method to significantly improve the tracking quality of base trackers. We also show that the proposed method outperforms by far segmentation-based trackers.","A method that first detects, at each frame, if a tracker tends to drift by analyzing saliency features of the output BB of a tracker, and then applies automatic seeded object segmentation on the BB to correct the drift once detected is proposed."

Subhalaxmi Pradhan","10.1002/wer.70148","","ABSTRACT Self‐healing membranes have emerged as an innovative solution to address critical challenges in water remediation, including fouling, mechanical wear, and chemical degradation, all of which severely compromise the performance and longevity of conventional membranes. Traditional filtration membranes often require frequent maintenance and replacement due to the accumulation of contaminants, structural damage, or chemical erosion, which increase operational costs and environmental impacts. Self‐healing membranes, on the other hand, offer a unique advantage by automatically repairing micro‐cracks, mitigating fouling, and rejuvenating their filtration capacity. By integrating advanced materials such as graphene oxide (GO), nanofibers, and MXenes, these membranes demonstrate enhanced chemical stability, mechanical strength, and antifouling properties, making them particularly effective in applications such as oil–water separation, desalination, and the removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants. Additionally, their self‐cleaning capabilities and resistance to environmental stresses significantly reduce downtime and operational inefficiencies in large‐scale water treatment systems. The incorporation of smart functionalities, such as stimuli‐responsive healing triggered by temperature, pH changes, or light, further enhances their adaptability to varying environmental conditions, making self‐healing membranes a sustainable and cost‐effective solution for long‐term water remediation.

With recent advancements in automobiles, medical devices, smart industrial systems, and other technologies, system failures resulting from external attacks or internal process malfunctions are increasingly common. Restoring the system’s stable state requires autonomous intervention through the self-healing process to maintain service quality. This paper, therefore, aims to analyse state of the art and identify where self-healing using machine learning can be applied to cyber–physical systems to enhance security and prevent failures within the system. The paper describes three key components of self-healing functionality in computer systems: anomaly detection, fault alert, and fault auto-remediation. The significance of these components is that self-healing functionality cannot be practical without considering all three. Understanding the self-healing theories that form the guiding principles for implementing these functionalities with real-life implications is crucial.

A recovery engine with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based decision-making approaches is presented—which chooses the best remedial actions from a pre-established catalogue in order to maximise system reliability and minimise downtime. The system is tested on an OpenStack-based video on demand service—where multiple issues are replicated in order to assess the efficaciousness of various recovery actions and workflows. The decision-making module of the recovery engine examines data from these experiments to determine the most effective remedial actions, taking into account their impact on the quality of service and other factors. The recovery engine is only meant to need human input when it comes to parameterizing and optimising decision models at particular points in time. In order to show how these AI-driven decision-making techniques can enhance mean time to repair and overall service quality in cloud environments—the study presents and assesses their results. This novel strategy represents a change towards cloud systems that are more sturdy autonomous, and able to effectively manage anomalies and recover from failure.

This paper proposes an advanced framework for autonomous network optimization, utilizing a DevOps-driven approach to enable self-healing capabilities in telecommunications networks. The framework integrates automation, machine learning, and real-time anomaly detection to facilitate proactive network management, minimizing downtime and enhancing operational efficiency. In traditional telecom network management, the detection and resolution of network issues are often reactive, leading to delays and performance degradation. The proposed self-healing network system, based on DevOps principles, automates the entire process of anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and resolution. The framework employs machine learning algorithms to continuously monitor network traffic and performance metrics, enabling real-time identification of potential issues such as congestion, service degradation, or security breaches. Upon detecting anomalies, the system automatically triggers corrective actions, including rerouting traffic, optimizing resource allocation, or scaling network components, all without human intervention. The architecture integrates key DevOps elements, such as continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, version control, and automated testing, to ensure rapid and reliable updates to the network infrastructure. This seamless integration of automation and machine learning enhances the system’s ability to adapt to evolving network conditions, providing a dynamic and self-optimizing network environment. The paper explores the benefits of this self-healing framework, including reduced operational costs, improved network uptime, and enhanced user experience. It also addresses the challenges associated with implementing such systems, including data quality, training models, and network complexity. Ultimately, this DevOps-based framework represents a significant step toward the future of autonomous, self-healing telecommunications networks, offering a foundation for the next generation of intelligent network management.

This study introduces a novel multi-layer self-healing infrastructure framework that unites predictive analytics, reinforcement learning (RL), and rule-based automation into a cohesive, horizontally scalable system. Predictive analytics continuously ingests telemetry—CPU, memory, network metrics, and application logs—using time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM) and unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, k-Means) to flag potential faults with &gt;96% accuracy. An RL agent employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) then dynamically selects recovery actions (e.g., container restart, horizontal scaling, resource reallocation) guided by a reward function that balances rapid Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) reduction with minimal resource overhead and service impact. Simultaneously, rule-based playbooks address frequent failure patterns, ensuring immediate remediation within 30 seconds for predictable incidents. Deployed as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via Terraform and Helm on Kubernetes clusters across AWS and Azure, our framework was validated over 220 fault scenarios. Key performance indicators demonstrate an 85% MTTR reduction (from 90 to 13.5 minutes), recovery reliability exceeding 95%, fault tolerance above 91%, and system uptime surpassing 98%. Resource overhead during recovery remains under 10%. Compared to prior isolated methods—rule-based MTTR reduction of 60%, RL-only MTTR reduction of 50%, and anomaly detection without remediation—our integrated model delivers superior resilience and operational efficiency.

Nicolás Cardozo","10.1145/3643915.3644097","","Self-healing systems depend on following a set of predefined instructions to recover from a known failure state. Failure states are generally detected based on domain specific specialized metrics. Failure fixes are applied at predefined application hooks that are not sufficiently expressive to manage different failure types. Self-healing is usually applied in the context of distributed systems, where the detection of failures is constrained to communication problems, and resolution strategies often consist of replacing complete components. However, current complex systems may reach failure states at a fine granularity not anticipated by developers (for example, value range changes for data streaming in IoT systems), making them unsuitable for existing self-healing techniques. To counter these problems, in this paper we propose a new self-healing framework that learns recovery strategies for healing fine-grained system behavior at run time. Our proposal targets complex reactive systems, defining monitors as predicates specifying satisfiability conditions of system properties. Such monitors are functionally expressive and can be defined at run time to detect failure states at any execution point. Once failure states are detected, we use a Reinforcement Learning-based technique to learn a recovery strategy based on users' corrective sequences. Finally, to execute the learned strategies, we extract them as Context-oriented Programming variations that activate dynamically whenever the failure state is detected, overwriting the base system behavior with the recovery strategy for that state. We validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework through a prototypical reactive application for tracking mouse movements, and the DeltaIoT exemplar for self-healing systems. Our results demonstrate that with just the definition of monitors, the system is effective in detecting and recovering from failures between 55% -- 92% of the cases in the first application, and at par with the predefined strategies in the second application.

System adminstrators desperately need help as complexity of networks and their management systems continue to grow unabatedly. In this paper, we describe how a multiple linear regression based parameter-influencer model can be used to build in Self-healing features in a network. We describe a scenario in a system where each parameter in the system is affected distinctly by many influencers. Statistical techniques are used to identify extent of dependency of parameters on more than one influencer. Empirical data and smaller ranges of values of data from case studies encouraged us to assume a linear relation as a starting point. After identifying the relationship amongst them the appropriate influencers are modified so as to affect the values of parameters. They are thus brought away from their threshold values and near their median values and in turn stability is brought into the system. Our model is programmed as a daemon on the network and a case study is described where historical data is used to tune the network parameters more accurately.","This paper describes a scenario in a system where each parameter in the system is affected distinctly by many influencers and a multiple linear regression based parameter-influencer model can be used to build in Self-healing features in a network."
