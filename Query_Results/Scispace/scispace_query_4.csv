Several tools, such as Terraform and CDK, support this environment. Selecting the appropriate tool is crucial to a project’s success, yet there is ambiguity about the circumstances in which developers should choose between these tools. Therefore, this study aims to compare Terraform and CDK across four aspects: abstraction, scalability, maintainability, and performance. Our findings indicate that each tool performs particularly well in specific scenarios. For instance, Terraform is better suited for experienced teams focused on rapid implementations, while CDK is more appropriate for less experienced teams prioritizing resource efficiency during implementation. ","This study compares Terraform and AWS CDK across abstraction, scalability, maintainability, and performance, finding that Terraform excels in rapid implementations for experienced teams, while CDK is better suited for less experienced teams prioritizing resource efficiency."

The research profile focuses on a methodology known in the professional environment as “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC) and is one of the foundational methodologies implemented in a systemic combination within the DevOps methodology. This methodology is actively used in processes of dynamic formation, deployment, and maintenance of corporate IT infrastructures in many modern successful high-tech companies to achieve the best business performance, efficiency, guaranteed success, and security. The article discusses two basic approaches to building software tools that implement the IaC methodology, namely the declarative and imperative approaches. The main emphasis is placed on the formation of a set of advantages and disadvantages inherent in software tools such as Terraform, ARM, Ansible, and CloudFormation. The focus of researchers on these four software tools is explained by their leading positions in a fairly extensive lineup of possible alternative software products that allow for a comprehensive implementation of the IaC methodology in the context of full and functional systemic deployment of the DevOps methodology in specific implementations of corporate IT infrastructures. The authors' generalized conclusion of original scientific research is that there is currently no single clearly distinguished universal software tool among others that fully satisfies the entire spectrum of requirements and needs. Potential users in this context are communities of DevOps professionals and clients – owners and managers of modern dynamic high- tech and successful companies, firms, and businesses that rely on modern information systems and technologies.

This paper proposes a conceptual model for a secure DevOps architecture that leverages Jenkins, Terraform, and Kubernetes to ensure continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code (IaC), and container orchestration, all underpinned by robust security principles. Jenkins facilitates automated building, testing, and deployment pipelines, while Terraform enables secure infrastructure provisioning through immutable, version-controlled configurations. Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications, providing dynamic scaling, automated failover, and efficient resource utilization. Together, these tools offer a powerful synergy that can automate development workflows while embedding security measures throughout the software delivery process. The proposed model introduces a security-first approach across the development lifecycle, encompassing code validation, vulnerability scanning, secrets management, policy enforcement, and runtime security. Jenkins pipelines integrate security scanners at multiple stages to detect vulnerabilities early. Terraform configurations are audited for compliance using tools such as Checkov and Terraform Compliance, ensuring secure infrastructure deployment. Kubernetes clusters are fortified with role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, admission controllers, and runtime threat detection solutions like Falco. This conceptual model emphasizes automation, scalability, and proactive threat mitigation, minimizing human error and enabling organizations to achieve secure, rapid software delivery. Additionally, it addresses challenges such as secrets management, with integrations like Vault and Sealed Secrets, and policy enforcement through tools like OPA-Gatekeeper. The model also recommends continuous monitoring and feedback loops to detect anomalies and enforce corrective actions in near real-time. By adopting this secure DevOps architecture, organizations can bridge the gap between agility and security, meeting modern demands for rapid innovation without compromising system integrity. This work contributes to the growing body of DevSecOps knowledge by providing a comprehensive framework that operationalizes security from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment.

The emergence of configuration management platforms between 2005-2012 introduced the transformative ""infrastructure as code"" paradigm, enabling version-controlled deployments and reducing configuration drift by over 80%. Cloud orchestration and containerization subsequently accelerated this progression, with enterprises achieving deployment time reductions exceeding 94% and dramatic improvements in operational efficiency.

Further, there is a need for flexible, timely reconfiguration of the infrastructure, e.g., to use pay-per-use infrastructure efficiently based on application load. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the DevOps tool to automate infrastructure. However, modern static IaC solutions only support infrastructures that are deployed and do not change afterward. To implement infrastructures that change dynamically over time, static IaC programs have to be (updated and) re-run, e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline, or configure an external orchestrator that implements the dynamic behavior, e.g., an autoscaler or Kubernetes operator. Both do not capture the dynamic behavior in the IaC program and prevent analyzing and testing the infrastructure configuration jointly with its dynamic behavior. To fill this gap, we envision dynamic IaC, which augments static IaC with the ability to define dynamic behavior within the IaC program. In contrast to static IaC programs, dynamic IaC programs run continuously. They re-evaluate program parts that depend on external signals when these change and automatically adjust the infrastructure accordingly. We implement DIaC as the first dynamic IaC solution and demonstrate it in two realistic use cases of broader relevance. With dynamic IaC, ensuring the program’s correctness is even harder than for static IaC because programs may define many target configurations in contrast to only a few. However, for this reason, it is also more critical. To solve this issue, we propose automated, specialized property-based testing for IaC programs and implement it in ProTI.","In this paper , the authors propose a dynamic infrastructure as code (DIaC) solution, which augments static IaaC with the ability to define dynamic behavior within the IaC program."

Application and process efficiency and automated infrastructure deployment stem from the connection between IaC technology and GitLab CI/CD tools. The document shows deployment processes by demonstrating actual code, which helps organizations gain competence in tool usage. During the actual implementation of the framework, deployment speed increased by 55%, as the framework reduced infrastructure costs by 25% and improved deployment reliability to 70%. Terraform and GitLab work together to transform DevOps operational frameworks based on the provided results. Implementing such a framework enables organizations to optimize their DevOps workflows, lowering manual tasks while expanding their CI/CD pipeline capabilities. The paper presents essential best practices and integration methods that provide essential knowledge about present-day software development requirements for automated deployments. ","This paper presents a framework for automating CI/CD pipelines using Terraform and GitLab, achieving scalability and efficiency through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) integration, resulting in 55% deployment speed increase, 25% cost reduction, and 70% reliability improvement."

Despite the proliferation of cloud service providers, the issue of vendor lock-in continues to pose significant challenges. Recent service disruptions have underscored the perils of exclusive reliance on a single provider. Existing cloud orchestration tools, while designed to mitigate these issues by facilitating deployments across multiple cloud providers, are often bound to provider-specific models. This necessitates users' familiarity with the unique offerings of each provider and may limit adaptability in the face of errors. To address these challenges, a custom wrapper is proposed that operates on top of Terraform, a leading Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool. This wrapper enables diverse cloud deployments through a customized configuration file, simplifying the process of auditing, configuring, and securing various deployments. Practical experiments confirm the seamless deployment of infrastructure across various cloud providers, notably AWS and Azure. Specifically, the successful deployment of a Linux VM on both platforms showcases the adaptability of the approach to diverse cloud environments. The solution also maintains an easy learning curve, ensuring accessibility and industry-friendliness for users managing infrastructure across different cloud providers.","Streamlining multi-cloud infrastructure orchestration with Terraform-based custom wrapper simplifies deployments across various platforms, mitigating vendor lock-in challenges and enhancing adaptability."

DevOps practices and Cloud computing are two key paradigms to tackle these issues by enabling rapid and continuous delivery of applications, utilizing automated software delivery pipelines. However, it is a complex and sophisticated challenge to implement such pipelines by installing, configuring, orchestrating, and integrating the required deployment automation solutions. Therefore, we present a method in conjunction with a framework and implementation to dynamically generate tailored deployment automation engines for specific application stacks, which are packaged in a portable manner to run them on various platforms and infrastructures. The core of our work is based on generating APIs for arbitrary deployment executables such as scripts and plans that perform different tasks in the automated deployment process. As a result, deployment tasks can be triggered through generated API endpoints, abstracting from lower-level, technical details of diverse deployment automation tooling. Beside a quantitative evaluation, we discuss two case studies in this context, one focusing on microservice architectures, the other one considering application functionality and its relation to deployment functionality.","This work presents a method in conjunction with a framework and implementation to dynamically generate tailored deployment automation engines for specific application stacks, which are packaged in a portable manner to run them on various platforms and infrastructures."

Modern software development has evolved to embrace IaC as a best practice for consistently provisioning and managing infrastructure using various tools such as Terraform and Ansible. However, recent studies highlighted that developers still encounter various challenges with IaC tools. Aims. We aim in this paper to understand the different challenges that developers encounter with IaC and analyze the trend of seeking assistance on Q&A platforms in the context of IaC. To this end, we conduct a large-scale empirical study investigating developers' discussions in Stack Overflow. Method. We first collect IaC-relevant tags on Stack Overflow, constituting a dataset that comprises 52,692 questions and 64,078 answers. Then, we group questions into specific topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method, which we optimize using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter's fine-tuning. Finally, to gain better insights, we analyze the identified topics based on different criteria such as popularity and difficulty. Results. Our findings reveal an average yearly increase of 150% in terms of IaC-related questions and 135% in terms of users between 2011 and 2022. Furthermore, we observe that IaC questions revolve around seven main topics: server configuration, policy configuration, networking, deployment pipelines, variable management, templating, and file management. Notably, we found that server configuration and file management are the most popular topics, i.e., the most discussed among IaC developers, while the deployment pipelines and templating topics are the most difficult. Conclusions. Our results shed light on IaC challenges that are often encountered by developers on popular Q&A platforms. These findings reveal important implications for practitioners seeking better support for IaC tools in real-world settings and for researchers to better understand the IaC community needs and further investigate IaC in different aspects.","A large-scale empirical study investigating developers' discussions in Stack Overflow finds that server configuration and file management are the most popular topics, i.e., the most discussed among IaC developers, while the deployment pipelines and templating topics are themost difficult."

This automation is enabled by the explicit definition of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), i.e., a set of scripts, often written in different modelling languages, which defines the infrastructure and applications to be deployed. We introduce the DevOps Modelling Language (DOML), a new Cloud modelling language for infrastructure deployments. DOML is a modelling approach that can be mapped into multiple IaC languages, addressing infrastructure provisioning, application deployment and configuration at once. The idea behind DOML is to use a single modelling paradigm which can help to reduce the need of deep technical expertise in using different specialised IaC languages. We present the DOML’s principles and discuss the related work on IaC languages. We demonstrate the DOML advantages for the end-user in comparison with state-of-the-art IaC languages such as Ansible, Terraform, and Cloudify, and show its effectiveness through an example.

The IaC approach supports code-centric tools that use scripts to specify the creation, updating and execution of cloud infrastructure resources. Since each cloud provider offers a different type of infrastructure, the definition of an infrastructure resource (e.g., a virtual machine) implies writing several lines of code that greatly depend on the target cloud provider. Model-driven tools, meanwhile, abstract the complexity of using IaC scripts through the high-level modeling of the cloud infrastructure. In a previous work, we presented an infrastructure modeling approach and tool (Argon) for cloud provisioning that leverages model-driven engineering and supports the IaC approach. The objective of the present work is to compare a model-driven tool (Argon) with a well-known code-centric tool (Ansible) in order to provide empirical evidence of their effectiveness when defining the cloud infrastructure, and the participants' perceptions when using these tools. We, therefore, conducted a family of three experiments involving 67 Computer Science students in order to compare Argon with Ansible as regards their effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. We used the AB/BA crossover design to configure the individual experiments and the linear mixed model to statistically analyze the data collected and subsequently obtain empirical findings. The results of the individual experiments and meta-analysis indicate that Argon is more effective as regards supporting the IaC approach in terms of defining the cloud infrastructure. The participants also perceived that Argon is easier to use and more useful for specifying the infrastructure resources.

"Deployment coordination for cross-functional DevOps teams","https://scispace.com/paper/deployment-coordination-for-cross-functional-devops-teams-3q4gz6z163","2021","Proceedings Article","Foundations of Software Engineering","Daniel Sokolowski","10.1145/3468264.3473101","","Software stability and reliability are the core concerns of DevOps. They are improved by tightening the collaboration between developers and operators in cross-functional teams on the one hand and by automating operations through continuous integration (CI) and infrastructure as code (IaC) on the other hand. Ideally, teams in DevOps are fully independent. Still, their applications often depend on each other in practice, requiring them to coordinate their deployment through centralization or manual coordination. With this work, we propose and implement the novel IaC solution µs ([mju:z] ”muse”), which automates deployment coordination in a decentralized fashion. µs is the first approach that is compatible with the DevOps goals as it enables truly independent operations of the DevOps teams. We define our research problem through a questionnaire survey with IT professionals and evaluate the solution by comparing it to other modern IaC approaches, assessing its performance, and applying it to existing IaC programs.","In this article, the authors propose µs, a decentralized IaC solution that enables truly independent operations of the DevOps teams, which is compatible with the goals of DevOps as it enables them to coordinate their deployment in a decentralized fashion."

Behlitsov","10.36910/6775-2524-0560-2024-56-12","","У цій статті розглядається комплексний підхід до автоматизації надання інфраструктури за допомогою Terraform і AWS. Основною метою цього дослідження було оптимізувати розгортання та керування хмарними ресурсами за допомогою практик інфраструктури як коду (IaC). Стаття починається з пояснення фундаментальних принципів інфраструктури як коду, підкреслюючи її переваги з точки зору послідовності, повторюваності та співпраці. Центральне місце в цій методології займає Terraform, інструмент із відкритим кодом, розроблений для декларативного керування конфігурацією. Здатність Terraform визначати компоненти інфраструктури за допомогою простих, зрозумілих для людини файлів конфігурації забезпечує потужний механізм для надання та керування хмарними ресурсами в різних провайдерів. Ключовим моментом реалізації є використання AWS як хмарного провайдера. AWS пропонує широкий спектр послуг, від обчислювальних екземплярів (EC2) до керованих баз даних (RDS) і безсерверних обчислень (Lambda). У статті розглядаються конкретні випадки використання, коли Terraform використовується для автоматизації надання ресурсів AWS, таких як екземпляри EC2 для масштабованих веб-додатків, бакети S3 для зберігання об’єктів і конфігурації VPC для ізоляції мережі. Важливим аспектом, який обговорюється в статті, є керування станом Terraform, який відстежує поточний стан розгорнутих ресурсів і полегшує співпрацю між членами команди. Стратегії обробки файлів стану, включно з конфігураціями віддаленої серверної частини за допомогою Amazon S3 для блокування, вивчаються, щоб забезпечити узгодженість і уникнути конфліктів під час одночасного розгортання. Крім того, стаття стосується модулів Terraform, які інкапсулюють багаторазові конфігурації для різних компонентів інфраструктури, сприяючи багаторазовому використанню коду та зручності обслуговування. Завдяки модульній конфігурації команди можуть стандартизувати найкращі практики та застосовувати політики в різних середовищах, від розробки до виробництва. Інтеграція Terraform з конвеєрами CI/CD автоматизує тестування та розгортання змін інфраструктури, сприяючи гнучкості та зменшуючи ручне втручання. Ця автоматизація не тільки прискорює доставку оновлень інфраструктури, але й підвищує загальну надійність системи за допомогою автоматизованого тестування та механізмів відкату.

However, if load on those servers changes unexpectedly, then it becomes tedious to scale the resources and requires skilled human power to manage such situations. It may increase the capital expenditure. Hence, many companies have started to migrate their on-premise applications to the cloud. This migration of the applications to the cloud is one of the major challenges. To setup and manage the growing complex infrastructure, after migrating these applications to the cloud are really a time-consuming and tedious process which results in downtime. Hence, we need to automate this environment. To achieve architecture for the distributed systems which support security, repeatability, reliability, and scalability, we require some cloud automation tools. This paper summarizes tools such as Terraform and cloud formation for infrastructure automation and Docker and Habitat for application automation.","To achieve architecture for the distributed systems which support security, repeatability, reliability, and scalability, this paper requires some cloud automation tools such as Terraform and cloud formation for infrastructure automation and Docker and Habitat for application automation."
