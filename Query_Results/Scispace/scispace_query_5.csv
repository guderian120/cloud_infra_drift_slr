This abstract explores how automation tools facilitate the provisioning, scaling, and management of cloud resources, while orchestration ensures seamless coordination of these tasks across multiple cloud environments. It highlights the role of technologies like containerization, microservices, and CI/CD pipelines in optimizing cloud operations. By implementing automation and orchestration, organizations can improve operational efficiency, reduce human error, and enhance resource utilization, enabling faster deployment and more responsive IT operations in hybrid cloud settings.

Introduction Private cloud infrastructures have been widely deployed across technology industries, research institutions and e-infrastructures in the past few years. The main motivations for this dedicated cloud infrastructures are the need to execute applications with bias in a single hardware architecture or software framework, security concerns and compliance with approved methodologies. However, as cloud federation is being adopted in commercial and open access environments, the limitations of relying on a single cloud provider have become apparent in terms of asset portability (virtual machine (VM) images, network/software configurations, user management, credentials, etc.), cloud interfaces and performance of public APIs (Nampalli, 2023). The natural evolution of this approach has been the development and deployment of application level plugins, capable of orchestrating the capabilities of several cloud interfaces. Fig 9.1: Cloud Automation vs Cloud Orchestration 9.1.1. Background and Significance Hybrid environments of data, applications, and services hosted in data centres, either on-premise or in the cloud, intersected by data flows across the network, have been used in many use cases. It is time to provide guarantees about the quality of the data and the computational resources that are exchanged. Through a layered architecture, we propose a novel solution to guarantee the Service Level Agreement compliance of complex applications in hybrid environments that cross administrative domains. This solution includes monitoring and control mechanisms capable of generating real-time alerts and coarse/fine grained actions in the data-centre and end-host transport devices to provide timely responses. In addition, controllers in each domain are fed-on with data plane metrics such as network and server performance. It is operators' duty to deploy and operate the tools needed to monitor and manage the domain carefully. Therefore, we rely on widely supported standards for modelling and orchestrating the behavior of complex applications, and for the definition of a common control plane with the enterprise. 9.1.2. Research Objectives Research has been initiated with the aim of contributing to the state-of-the-art in Automation and Orchestration in Hybrid Clouds. There are three key objectives: (1) to analyse novel approaches and commercial tools for Automation and Orchestration in Hybrid Clouds, (2) to propose a theoretical model and solution for the Automation and Orchestration of Hybrid Clouds considering heterogeneous cloud computing environments and multiple providers, and (3) to validate the proposed automation and orchestration model and solution by applying it to a practical use-case scenario—a Science Gateway for a bioinformatics VRE. Starting with an analysis of existing work in the field, the focus on open-source tools often based on general-purpose programming languages stands out. Containerization technologies are favoured for this purpose, either combined with a Container Orchestrator (Syed, 2023). Relatively little attention is paid to modelling languages in the Cloud Application Programming Interface domain or to commercial platforms. However, novel approaches and commercial tools for the subject under study are being continuously developed and disseminated. Amongst other objectives throughout this work, a systematic review is presented of the available approaches and tools for Automation and Orchestration in Hybrid Clouds encompassing cost and efficiency issues plus new demands which may factor into the choice of tools or methods. 9.2. Fundamentals of Automation and Orchestration There is no denying the pervasion of cloud technologies into any kind of ICT environment: having in 2016 passed the tipping point of application workloads running in the cloud in data centers versus running on traditional IT, projections estimate that the ratio might be in 80%/20% (cloud/IT) by 2024. Cloud services reach or exceed a most privileged position in the 5G E2E service provisioning chain. Within the cloud stack, as type of usage estimate increases, and software-defined clouds generalize, the pressure of exposing and consuming cloud services/APIs increases (Danda, 2024). Enhanced cloud services/APIs for real-time scaling, chaining, metering, charging, QoS, KPI exposure and transfer across CSP domains, end-to-end analytics, SLA negotiation and enforcement are foreseen. Such enhancements will span across cloud-orchestration interfaces and will apply on both public and private clouds. In addition to enhancing cloud functionalities, there is a considerable part of those enhancements to extend or partially overlap on the contact point to the carrier cloud, consisting in NFV POPs with additional capabilities. It applies particularly in the case of closed groups of NFVI within a Carrier DC. Besides APIs and policies, enhancements relate to VNF/PNF modeling, descriptors, and monitoring data. Equation 1: Load Balancing Equation 9.2.1. Definition and Concepts Private cloud infrastructures are now widely deployed and adopted across technology industries and research institutions. Public cloud providers offer large compute and storage resources on-demand and deliver a pay-as-you-go model. Although cloud computing has emerged as a reality, a single cloud provider cannot fully satisfy the complex requirements of some scientific user communities who need specific applications, particular software stacks and special configurations. In this context, there is a growing interest in developing hybrid cloud solutions that bind together distinct and heterogeneous cloud infrastructures. Those approaches aim at simplifying the access to global and integrated e-resources for the final users. Moreover, the seamless integration of resources accessible through public or private cloud systems and through grid middleware is a major challenge for the Hybrid Grid/Cloud Activity. 9.2.2. Key Technologies Private cloud infrastructures are now widely deployed, adopted and well recognized across technology industries and research institutions, since they provide a new service-based approach for the flexible on-demand usage of virtualized resources (Syed, 2023). In particular, private clouds are considered a good choice for virtualizing industry and research legacy clusters in order to facilitate an evolution from traditional high performance computing to more complex and large scale processing and data analysis. However, they are often not enough by themselves and a growing interest is emerging for the development of hybrid cloud solutions that bind together distinct and heterogeneous cloud infrastructures. There is an increasing number of companies operating cloud marketplaces offering a very broad variety of different types of cloud resources. Joined with the developments carried out in the third platform technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics, complex hybrid cloud scenarios may be composed. Fig: NetDevOps Is Driving the Future of Hybrid Cloud Automation 9.3. Challenges and Benefits in Hybrid Cloud Environments Companies and organizations are increasingly enthusiastic about deploying applications, services, and storing data in public cloud environments, attracted by the flexibility, scalability and pay-per-use cost models offered by these services. However, private clouds are still essential for management of resources and storage of critical and data-sensitive applications inside the boundaries of companies and institutions. For these reasons, a growing number of industries and research organizations are now investing in solutions that combine private and public cloud platforms. With the growth of hybrid cloud and multi-cloud infrastructures, interoperability can become an issue. Among the different technologies being developed to overcome this challenge, orchestration has gained a leading role. This technology can be understood as the automation of workflows representing complex services that contain other services with the aim of providing the requested service (Nampalli, 2022). In the context of cloud, these complex services are composed of simple services such as virtual machines, storage appliances, load balancers or application servers. Fig 9.2: Hybrid Cloud Challenges 9.3.1. Security and Compliance Today's demanding and evolving business environment forces companies to react quickly to innovations and new trends. Cloud computing was adopted to address flexibility, scalability and agility requirements. The advances in cloud technologies and adoption of IT as a Service (ITaaS) concept in enterprise environments lead to Hybrid Cloud infrastructures that allow the orchestration and automation of cross-domain services. After the infrastructure, that should be as a service itself, in its Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach, it is possible to orchestrate services across cloud providers using new mechanisms to automate the management and control of resources, security and networking aspects. Running a cloud service starting from the allocation of virtual network and computing resources to the plugging of specific security mechanisms normally requires not standardized and hardly programmable steps. Automation and orchestration technologies can be adopted for automating cloud infrastructures management. Orchestrators receive high level instructions and requests to provide some services and may decompose complex service manuals into a chain of individual API calls to low-level components. Hybrid Cloud Management allows to simplify the operations rules and the control of private and public resources, easing the automation and increasing the service level agreement guarantees that can be offered. Standards have been designed to ease the request of services to different providers. TOSCA can be the choice for this challenge, where the goal is to deploy complex web services. 9.3.2. Scalability and Flexibility Existing solutions offer some automation with the advantage that most of them allow composing custom workflows, i.e., chaining multiple tasks that can range between deploying complex distributed applications in different clouds to simple steps like downloading and uploading files. The scalability and performance of cloud applications are improved with the suggested solution that is based on microservices and their dynamic orchestration in a cloud computing environment. The purpose is to define a generic microservices-based architecture for application-level cloud orchestration and to describe its reference implementation utilizing container-based open source cloud technologies (Kothapalli et al., 2022). Hybrid cloud setups combining private data centers and public cloud providers are a norm for a larger class of users, than public clouds alone. However, as a consequence, the number of involved sites often exceeds the support of existing solutions which are built either for a single infrastructure or rather focused on orchestrating a single application. Nevertheless, the scalability problem is investigated and (partially) solved in connection with the WS-PGRADE/gUSE gateway framework, particularly for the data staging service that needs such scalability. 9.4. Case Studies and Best Practices Article writing is a very important part of automation as users either ask for more functionality, or try to adjust current functions to work more efficiently. This article presents an overview of current work on IT and cybersecurity challenges for the future Internet and presents perspectives on the responses and needs to manage the significant challenges that arise in the course of the advent of 5G and beyond mobile networks. New standards and new IT technologies, such as cloud computing, software-down networks, and network functions virtualization, are fundamentally changing the telecommunications sector. A task force has been established to explore the impact of cloudification of future telecommunication networks. The work relies on a two-strand approach: first, a set of scenarios are presented detailing the implementation of the cloud environment of the network operator in the short-term future; secondly, to evaluate the impact of scenarios on network performance and interpretation. A new industry and academic report discusses a network operator's view of the changing environment and its effects, looking at network performance and other implications for regulation and general social networks comment. Equation 2: Service Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance Equation 9.4.1. Successful Implementations Public and private clouds are now widely adopted by academia, research, and enterprise, to the extent that almost every institution lacks the capacity or will to maintain on-premises small or medium data centres. Still, the IT scenarios for institutions are so varied that no single cloud model can fit them all. Many institutions can leverage their private clouds to meet their unique requirements, while also exploiting capabilities of industrial clouds for heavy computations or offloading specific services. This is also the hybrid cloud model, where a private cloud solution is federated with one or more industrial clouds (Subhash et al., 2022). Despite being a very promising paradigm, it poses some challenges in application deployment, particularly when services from multiple clouds should be orchestrated. There are several successful implementations of fully automated application deployments on public or federated clouds. Solutions for complex multi-instance architectures can deploy complex multi-instance architectures. There are solutions to manage and effectively use resources from different cloud providers. In the commercial scene, there are offerings for the management of a variety of public cloud providers. Fig: Service design and orchestration revenue grew 9.4.2. Lessons Learned Hybrid Clouds are cost-effective solutions for enterprises aiming at expanding their in-house computational resources with computing capacity rented from commercial cloud providers. Expanding in-house resources with others on demand in public clouds constitutes a hybrid cloud scenario and it is a very good solution as it allows companies to operate profitably, being able to absorb sudden workload spikes. The System is composed of an in-house private cloud infrastructure, interfacing with the European private cloud infrastructure that offers connections to public cloud providers as well. A pilot deployment on private and public resources is considered. A basic requirement to enable hybrid clouds is to provide access to the internal private cloud (Cloud A in the rest of the document) and isolation also from other tenants, the user's workload will run on a new cheap Open Nebula cloud cluster installation located on its own premises. Once the simple initial setup is completed, a major service running on the private cloud demands the intensive usage of computational resources to consider a commercial public cloud (namely Cloud B) (Sondinti et al., 2023). Cloud configuration will be done automatically relying on software tools. Two tools work in sequence, the multi IaaS Orchestrator and the IaaS Agent. The former is asked by a client to set up a new environment and triggers the latter, which modifies the infrastructures in order to host applications of a given Topology and Capacity on private and/or public IaaS cloud providers. The implemented procedure and the scalability of the multi cloud service are described in context with the INDIGO initiative. 9.5. Future Directions In this paper, automation of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is considered, i.e., how to render inter-network element services to automatically instantiate VNFs over network domains that rely on different technologies and are under different administrations. The proposed approach, referred to as cross-domain Orchestration, is also able to configure underlying connectivity services required by the VNFs. The employment of a common Information Model (IM) and Southbound Interface (SBI) with common interface primitives and request/reply messages are proposed for the standardized API between domains. The functionality and interfaces of a multi-domain Orchestrator are also described. This work falls within the context of the T-NOVA project, which focuses on the definition of a reference architecture for a Stub-Orchestrator for Composition and Rendition (SOC-R) Platform. Two solutions for new service operations are presented, one for zero-touch operations and another for predictive maintenance and reconfiguration (Vankayalapati et al., 2023). Besides, federated access and controlled sharing of resources across different operators for the provisioning of advanced services are envisioned. The cloud systems are an incarnation of the economic principles of software service delivery - effective utilization of common resources and commodification. This paper focuses on the automation of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) and the seamless instantiation of these functions across network domains that utilize diverse technologies and are governed by different administrations. The proposed solution, termed cross-domain orchestration, not only automates the instantiation of VNFs but also manages the underlying connectivity services necessary for their operation. A key feature of this approach is the use of a common Information Model (IM) and Southbound Interface (SBI), which facilitates standardized communication between different domains through consistent interface primitives and request/reply messages. The paper outlines the functionality and interfaces of a multi-domain orchestrator within the context of the T-NOVA project, which aims to develop a reference architecture for the Stub-Orchestrator for Composition and Rendition (SOC-R) platform. Fig 9.3: Thoughts on The Future of Hybrid Cloud IT 9.6. Conclusion The automation of the service provisioning implies the dynamic allocation and management across different operative domains. The networking community is adopting cloud computing to answer to emerging requirements and use cases, whereas the cloud community is building geographically distributed computing infrastructure requiring interconnection. Furthermore, up to now, the focus on cloud automation has been set on the computational and the storage side, paying little or no attention to the corresponding required networking resources, which are fundamental to ensure the end-to-end performance required by the services. Common uses of orchestration involve heterogeneous network domains, known as network orchestration, or cloud and network resources, exemplified by the emerging use case of interconnection of segregated data centers. A data-center could be defined as a centralized resource pool for the storage, management, processing and distribution of data and information organized pertaining to a particular business. Whereas at an early stage of the development of data-center terrestrial network access has been enough, the exponentially increasing amount and mobility of data have forced data-center to widely adopt hybrid satellite/fixed networks. 9.6.1. Future Trends Private cloud infrastructures are widely deployed and adopted across technology industries and research institutions. This situation has led to increased interest in the development of hybrid cloud solutions that bind together distinct and heterogeneous cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, this situation opens a new challenging landscape regarding the management of such hybrid cloud environments (Maguluri et al., 2022). The challenge can be approached by enabling interoperability among the distinct cloud environments. In this context two different conventions emerge when referring to the way the different cloud environments are interconnected: The Inter-Cloud and the Multi-Cloud. Broadly speaking, the Multi-Cloud is focused on bundling together different (similar or not) cloud providers to cope the computational needs of a given application. It refers to the fact that there are a certain number of commercial and/or academic cloud providers offering distinct cloud environments to deploy applications. In Multi-Cloud approaches, neither a priori agreements are necessary with the cloud providers about technologies, interfaces or services to be offered, nor affiliations are needed among the cloud providers. This way, the distinct cloud environments are hidden from the users. Inter-Cloud approaches are focused on the federation of different cloud provider's environments. This is achieved by establishing agreements between the cloud providers to define the interfaces and services to be offered, ensuring pre-defined Service Level Agreements (SLA). Such agreements refer to the formal thresholds in relation to the quality and value of the services. References Danda, R. R. (2024).

Integrating artificial intelligence into cloud management addresses complexity, manual intervention, and reactive problem-solving challenges that plague traditional orchestration methods. By implementing intelligent algorithms for resource allocation, workload balancing, predictive scaling, security enhancement, and self-healing capabilities, organizations can transform their cloud operations from manually-defined workflows to autonomous systems capable of continuous optimization. These advanced orchestration technologies enable dynamic resource distribution based on usage patterns and forecasted demand while simultaneously identifying cost-saving opportunities through workload consolidation and intelligent scheduling. Security frameworks are significantly strengthened through anomaly detection, predictive threat intelligence, and adaptive access control policies that evolve with changing organizational needs. Perhaps most transformative is the ability of self-healing infrastructure to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate issues before they cause service disruptions, dramatically reducing the operational burden on technical teams and allowing them to focus on innovation rather than troubleshooting.

Network latency and instability between cloud platforms in various countries and accessibility between data centers of different security levels also makes orchestration not easy to manage. Orchestration tools, such as Ansible[1], has high requirements for many server ports and network quality. In a complex network environment, SaltStack[2] or Puppet[3], cannot deal with the multi-cloud management of large-scale computing and storage resource nodes. Apache Ambari[4], for applications that run on different cloud computing service providers, it lacks effective management capabilities. Therefore, it is difficult for common orchestration management tools to overcome these problems. In this paper, we propose a global multi-cloud orchestration framework (MCOF), which converts the orchestration instructions initiated from the MCOF master into a standardized orchestration definition model that is distributed to the MCOF workers inside each data center through the message queue. Then the MCOF workers perform the orchestration activities suitable for the corresponding cloud service provider behind the data center firewall to adapt to the complex cloud platform operating environment, and achieve standardization, efficiency, quality, reliability, and traceable orchestration management.","A global multi-cloud orchestration framework (MCOF) is proposed, which converts the orchestration instructions initiated from the MCOF master into a standardized orchestration definition model that is distributed to the M COF workers inside each data center through the message queue."

The use of multi-cloud techniques has increased as businesses use cloud computing more and more to meet their computational demands. A thorough analysis of cloud architectures intended for distributed multi-cloud computing is presented in this study, with an emphasis on federated and hybrid cloud systems. The study looks at the opportunities and difficulties of adopting and overseeing a variety of cloud resources from several providers. The review starts out by going over the basic ideas and reasons for using multi-cloud strategies, emphasizing how important flexibility, scalability, and resilience are in contemporary computing settings. The study then explores the nuances of hybrid cloud architectures, with a focus on how private and public cloud resources can be seamlessly combined. In the context of hybrid cloud installations, important factors including data sovereignty, security, and workload orchestration are covered.

This systematic review aims to evaluate and synthesize the current landscape of integration techniques used in hybrid cloud infrastructure projects, with a focus on interoperability, orchestration, data synchronization, and security compliance. This examines peer-reviewed literature, technical white papers, and industry reports published between 2015 and 2024 to identify dominant patterns, frameworks, and tools employed in hybrid cloud integration. Findings indicate that integration strategies in hybrid cloud environments often rely on middleware platforms, API gateways, container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. Middleware and APIs serve as critical enablers for seamless communication between heterogeneous systems, while containerization ensures portability across cloud boundaries. Moreover, service mesh architectures and microservices-based designs are increasingly adopted to enhance scalability and observability. Security and compliance integration techniques, including identity federation, encryption standards, and policy-as-code frameworks, are also frequently cited to address regulatory requirements. The review highlights a growing interest in using AI-driven automation to manage integration complexity, especially for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection. Despite significant advances, challenges remain in achieving seamless hybrid cloud integration, particularly in areas related to latency, data governance, and vendor lock-in. The review concludes with a proposed research agenda and best practices for selecting integration techniques based on organizational needs, application architecture, and compliance considerations. By providing a consolidated view of current practices and emerging trends, this review offers valuable insights for IT professionals, cloud architects, and decision-makers involved in hybrid cloud projects.

Standardization is a definitive method of providing an end-to-end solution capable of defining, deploying, and managing applications and their components across heterogeneous cloud providers. TOSCA and CAMP, however, perform different functions with regard to cloud applications. TOSCA is focused primarily on topology modeling and orchestration, whereas CAMP is focused on deployment and management of applications. This paper presents a novel solution that not only involves the combination of the emerging standards TOSCA and CAMP, but also introduces extensions to CAMP to allow for multi-cloud application orchestration through the use of declarative policies. Extensions to the CAMP platform are also made, which brings the standards closer together to enable a seamless integration. Our proposal provides an end-to-end cloud orchestration solution that supports a cloud application modeling and deployment process, allowing a cloud application to span and be deployed over multiple clouds.

Managing multiple cloud platforms simultaneously creates significant challenges for organizations, often resulting in operational inefficiencies due to platform heterogeneity, fragmented security policies , and poor resource utilization that negatively impacts cost management and environmental sustainability. The proposed research introduces a unified self-service cloud portal with custom-built cloud connectors that enables seamless orchestration across major cloud service providers including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Implementing a modular architecture with standardized interfaces, automated resource management, and comprehensive security controls, reducing operational complexity by 40% while maintaining consistent governance across platforms. One key innovation is combining intelligent cross-platform resource optimization with a novel Green Score metric that integrates real-time utilization, energy efficiency, and application performance data—through integration with provider-specific sustainability tools and intelligent workload placement, achieving up to 45% reduction in carbon footprint for flexible workloads and 35% improvement in resource utilization. Optimizing cloud resources helps avoid unnecessary costs and efficiently provision resources 1 thus making the cloud systems greener. The proposed solution’s work advances multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action), demonstrating that operational efficiency and environmental sustainability can be simultaneously achieved in multi-cloud environments.

However, although many providers offer specific tools for HA support, like floating IPs and load balancing, the analysis of downtime at public cloud providers in previous years shows that a combination of several availability zones or cloud providers is required to achieve “five nines” availability. Besides reducing the chances of failure, the use of multiple availability zones and geographically distributed clouds may additionally bring performance and cost benefits. However, the orchestration, in an efficient and adaptive way, of HA multi-tier services in multi-zone and multi-cloud environments brings several challenges. This paper presents a novel orchestration method to automate the deployment and management of high availability multi-tier services on multiple availability zones, by introducing new affinity mechanisms, such as VM to location and role to role affinity/anti-affinity rules. Furthermore, we also extend this solution to multi-cloud scenarios, based on the replication or distribution of the service components among various clouds, along with their corresponding affinity rules.","This paper presents a novel orchestration method to automate the deployment and management of high availability multi-tier services on multiple availability zones, by introducing new affinity mechanisms, such as VM to location and role to role affinity/anti-affinity rules."

We are assisting to a change of paradigm, from the usage of a single cloud provider to the combination of multiple cloud service types, affecting the way in which applications are designed, developed, deployed and operated over such heterogeneous ecosystems.

Multi-cloud environments, which involve the use of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs), offer businesses the flexibility to optimize performance, improve resource allocation, and mitigate risks such as downtime, vendor lock-in, and service interruptions. This review explores the design principles and best practices for creating multi-cloud architectures that enhance enterprise scalability while simultaneously driving cost efficiencies. By leveraging the strengths of various CSPs such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud businesses can tailor their infrastructure to meet specific workload requirements and capitalize on competitive pricing models, ensuring better resource utilization and reducing the risk of under or over-provisioning. Scalability in multi-cloud architectures is achieved by implementing load balancing, auto-scaling, and failover mechanisms across multiple platforms. These systems can dynamically allocate resources in response to fluctuating demand, ensuring high availability and optimized performance. Additionally, the review discusses the key technologies that enable multi-cloud management, such as cloud management platforms (CMPs), containerization, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, which help streamline operations and simplify the complex task of managing resources across disparate cloud environments. Cost reduction in multi-cloud is achieved by optimizing resource usage, selecting the right pricing models (e.g., on-demand, reserved, or spot pricing), and automating scaling and resource management. The review also highlights the importance of adopting security best practices to manage data privacy and compliance across multiple clouds. Finally, the review presents real-world case studies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of multi-cloud strategies, illustrating how enterprises can scale operations effectively while reducing infrastructure costs. This research underscores the transformative potential of multi-cloud architectures in modern enterprise environments, emphasizing their role in achieving business agility, cost optimization, and operational efficiency.

However, semantic differences between cloud providers, as well as their heterogeneous management interfaces, make changing from one provider to another very complex and costly. This is quite challenging for the implementation of multi-cloud systems. In this paper, we aim to take advantage of formal methods to define a precise semantics for multi-clouds. We propose fclouds, a formal-based framework for semantic interoperability in multi-clouds. This framework contains a catalogue of formal models that mathematically describe cloud APIs and reason over them. A precise alignment can be described between their concepts, which promotes semantic interoperability.","In this paper, a formal-based framework for semantic interoperability in multi-clouds is proposed, which contains a catalogue of formal models that mathematically describe cloud APIs and reason over them."

This paper presents the Supercloud, a cloud service comprising resources obtained from several diverse IaaS cloud providers, and discusses opportunities, limitations, and future research directions. Currently, the Supercloud has been deployed using resources from several major cloud providers, including Amazon EC2, Rackspace, HP Cloud, and some private clouds. VMs run in a virtual network and can be migrated seamlessly across different clouds, with different hypervisors and device models. Using case studies we demonstrate that, being able to deploy applications to more regions and granting more control to end-users, the Supercloud can reduce latency and cost compared to the underlying cloud providers.","Using case studies, it is demonstrated that, being able to deploy applications to more regions and granting more control to end-users, the Supercloud can reduce latency and cost compared to the underlying cloud providers."

Many commercial cloud providers have emerged in the past 6-7 years, and each typically provides its own cloud infrastructure, APIs and application description formats to access the cloud resources, as well as support for service level agreements (SLAs). Such vendor lock-in has seriously limited the flexibility that cloud end users would like to process, when it comes to deploy applications over different infrastructures in different geographic locations, or to migrate a service from one provider's cloud to another. To enable seamless sharing of resources from a pool of cloud providers, efforts have emerged recently to facilitate cloud interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple cloud providers to work together, from both the industry and academia.

However, cloud users are often forced into vendor lock-in due to the use of incompatible APIs, cloud-specific services, and complex pricing models of the cloud service providers (CSPs). Cloud management platforms (CMPs), supporting hybrid and multi-cloud deployment, offer an answer by providing a unified abstract interface to multiple cloud platforms. Nonetheless, modelling applications to use multi-clouds, automated resource selection based on user requirements from various available CSPs, cost optimization, security, and runtime adaptation of deployed applications still remain a challenge.

To prevent vendor lock-in and increase redundancy, hybrid cloud architectures mix on-premises infrastructure with public and private cloud environments, while multi-cloud makes use of numerous cloud service providers. The performance optimisation methodologies of hybrid and multi-cloud systems are the main subject of this paper's comparative investigation. Using metrics like efficiency, adaptability, security, scalability, and performance, we compare and contrast the two designs and highlight their respective benefits and drawbacks. We also investigate and assess the effects of numerous optimisation methods on the system's overall performance, such as load balancing, resource allocation, and network performance management.

Cloud resource orchestration is challenging due to the rapid growth of data centers, the high failure rate of commodity hardware, the enforcement of service and engineering rules, the increasing sophistication of cloud services, and the requirement to fulfill provider operational objectives and customer service level agreements (SLAs). 
Towards addressing these challenges, this dissertation makes following contributions: (1) An automated resource orchestration platform that allows cloud operators to declaratively specify optimization goals and constraints given provider operational objectives and customer SLAs. Based on these specifications, orchestration commands are automatically generated to optimize resource configurations and allocations within the cloud; (2) A highly available transactional resource orchestration platform for building IaaS cloud infrastructures. Transactional orchestration procedures automatically guarantee atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID) properties for cloud operations. Transactional semantics provide a clean abstraction which enables cloud operators to focus on developing high level cloud services without worrying about the complexities of accessing and managing underlying volatile distributed resources. 
We present the design and implementation of our transactional automated cloud orchestration platform. Using realistic scenarios and workloads derived from production cloud services, we demonstrate that our platform is able to automatically orchestrate compute, storage, and network resources within and across geographically distributed data centers to meet operational objectives and SLAs.","An automated resource orchestration platform that allows cloud operators to declaratively specify optimization goals and constraints given provider operational objectives and customer service level agreements (SLAs) and a highly available transactional resource orchestrate platform for building IaaS cloud infrastructures."

From the customer’s perspective, in a market landscape where the cloud offer is highly diversified due to the presence of multiple competing service providers, picking the service that best accommodate their specific needs is a critical challenge. Once the choice is made, so called “cloud orchestration tools” (orchestrators) are required to take care of the customer application’s life-cycle.

The main benefit is the possibility to add support to any cloud platforms at a very low implementation cost.

To ensure a seamless, unified, and enterprise-compliant acquisition of the capabilities by client applications, the presence of a cross-cloud API mediation service is crucial. However, as the number and heterogeneity of aaS-endpoints increase, delivering the API mediation service at scale becomes increasingly costly. This paper presents a robust approach to API service mediation in enterprise-grade hybrid-multicloud computing environments. It tackles the challenges, offering a distributed architecture comprising dynamically composed managed microservices, microservice zones, intelligent endpoint selection, and adaptive statistical learning (aiming to exploit localities in performance history of aaS-endpoint invocations and to facilitate adding or removing active aaS-endpoints).

To preserve the cost-efficiency of multi-cloud deployments, it is essential to redeploy microservices onto the available nodes according to a dynamic resource configuration, which is often performed to better accommodate workload variations. However, this approach leads to frequent service disruption since applications are continuously shutdown and redeployed in order to apply the new resource assignment. To overcome this issue, we propose a re-orchestration scheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update scheduling logic. Specifically, we propose an integer linear optimization problem that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and that ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same regional cluster. The resulting rescheduling order guarantees no service disruption by repacking microservices between the available nodes without the need to turn off the outdated microservice instance before redeploying the updated version. In addition, we propose a two-step heuristic scheme that effectively approximates the optimal solution at the expense of close-to-zero service disruption and QoS violation probability. Results show that proposed schemes achieve better performance in terms of cost mitigation, low service disruption and low QoS violation probability compared to baseline schemes replicating Kubernetes scheduler functionalities.","A re-orchestration scheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update scheduling logic is proposed that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and that ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same regional cluster."

In this context, the resource fragmentation caused by frequent changes in the resource demands of deployed microservices, along with the allocation or termination of new and existing microservices, increases the deployment cost. Therefore, re-orchestrating deployed microservices on a cheaper configuration of multi-cloud nodes offers a practical solution to restore the cost efficiency of deployment. However, the rescheduling procedure causes frequent service interruptions due to the continuous termination and rebooting of the containerized microservices. Moreover, it may potentially interfere with and delay other deployment operations, compromising the stability of the running applications. To address this issue, we formulate a multi-objective integer linear programming problem that computes a microservice rescheduling solution capable of providing minimum deployment cost without significantly affecting the service continuity. At the same time, the proposed formulation also preserves the quality of service (QoS) requirements, including latency, expressed through microservice colocation constraints. Additionally, we present a heuristic algorithm to approximate the optimal solution, striking a balance between cost reduction and service disruption mitigation. We integrate the proposed approach as a custom plugin of the Kubernetes scheduler. Results reveal that our approach significantly reduces multi-cloud deployment costs and service disruptions compared to the default Kubernetes scheduler implementation, while ensuring QoS requirements are consistently met.

While the cloud brings several benefits, there are still some challenges that need to be overcome to apply the cloud model in certain scenarios. One such problem is the so-called vendor lock-in since different cloud providers offer peculiar and often incompatible services, which results in the automatic migration impossibility of the application between cloud providers. This issue becomes even more problematic when thinking of future applications composed of services or components hosted by different cloud providers in a multi-cloud environment. Dealing with vendor lock-in in multiple clouds requires addressing two important challenges: interoperability and portability. Some solutions have been proposed to deal with both problems, but most of them fail to provide flexibility. Therefore, we propose PacificClouds, a novel architecture based on microservices for addressing interoperability in a multi-cloud environment. PacificClouds differs from previous works by providing greater flexibility due to the microservices architectural pattern. In this article, we also propose a definition of microservices and a comparative analysis of the works related to PacificClouds. Finally, we show the main challenges of PacificClouds, and we point out the future directions.","This article proposes PacificClouds, a novel architecture based on microservices for addressing interoperability in a multi-cloud environment and differs from previous works by providing greater flexibility due to the microservices architectural pattern."

Applications based on microservice architecture are an example. Meanwhile, multiclouds are widely accepted by enterprise as an infrastructure strategy; however, challenges remain. The autonomous and distributable nature of modern applications, as well as the complexity of multicloud infrastructure, often make universal application deployment management impractical. This phenomenon may further hinder application quality and efficiency. Therefore, deployment resource control and topology discovery in the multicloud infrastructure environment is an intriguing area of cloud computing research. This paper proposes a framework to manage application deployment in the multicloud environment. The framework uses a policy-based deployment control to automatically select and provide deployment resources from the multicloud infrastructure, and it subsequently uses topology discovery to visualize and verify the actual deployment. The proposed framework design is introduced in the paper, and a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented. Experiments in empirical scenarios are conducted.

In a hybrid cloud, numerous resources like Virtual Machines (VMs) and Physical Machines in different clouds have to be managed together to make the whole hybrid cloud work cost-effectively. For controlling the management cost, in particular the manual management cost, many programs have been developed to take over manual management tasks or reduce their complexity and difficulty. These programs are usually hard-coded by languages like Java and C++, which bring enough capability and flexibility but also cause high programming effort and cost. As the architecture-based runtime model is causally connected with the corresponding running system automatically, constructing a hybrid cloud management system based on the architecture-based runtime models of clouds can benefit from the model-specific natures, and thus reduce the development workload. This paper proposes a runtime architecture based approach to developing the management programs in a simple but powerful enough manner. First of all, the manageability (such as APIs, configuration files and scripts) of different kinds of clouds, is abstracted as a runtime architecture based model of cloud software architecture, which can automatically and immediately propagate any observable runtime changes of the target platforms to the corresponding architecture models, and vice versa. Second, we provide a unified model of cloud software architecture, according to the domain knowledge of current cloud platforms, such as Cloud Stack, Open Stack and Eucalyptus. Third, the synchronization between the unified model and cloud runtime models is ensured through model transformation, thus, all the management tasks of the hybrid cloud, could be carried out through executing programs on the unified model, which decreases the complexity of use and management. The experiment on a real-world hybrid cloud demonstrates the feasibility, effectiveness and benefits of the new approach to managing hybrid clouds.","A runtime architecture based approach to developing the management programs in a simple but powerful enough manner and provides a unified model of cloud software architecture, according to the domain knowledge of current cloud platforms, such as Cloud Stack, Open Stack and Eucalyptus."

In term of service deployment, auto-scaling is usually not interoperable between multiple cloud platforms. As a result, the service level auto-scaling strategy needs to be configured separately on disparate cloud platforms, which incurs difficulties in tracing the configuration and maintaining consistent deployment. This paper presents a model-driven method to connect a cloud platform independent model of services with cloud specific operations.
